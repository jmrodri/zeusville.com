So my Gnome 3 (gnome-shell, Fedora 18) went to screensaver. When I unlocked it this is what my desktop looks like. [![lockup](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lockup.png?w=549)](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lockup.png) How do I get out of this? My machine is running fine. I can ssh into it and it's running normal but I can't interact with the desktop. Quite annoying.
