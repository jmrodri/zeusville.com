I found this nifty little [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) program called [gTweakUI](http://gtweakui.sourceforge.net/index.php) which is a TweakUI for GNOME. It allows you to turn off spatial browsing, as well as change the GNOME splash screen.

Also checkout the new [http://www.gnomefiles.org](http://www.gnomefiles.org) website.
