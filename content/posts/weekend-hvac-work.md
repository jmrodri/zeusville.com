This weekend I replaced my Trane Weathertron BAYSTAT240A thermostat with a Honeywell RTH7400D. I used the same thermostat on my conventional heat system and wanted to use it with the heatpump.

The conventional heat was easy all wires matched up. But the heat pump had a tan wire connected to the "T" terminal. The instructions for the RTH7400D don't mention anything about a "T" terminal. But that's what [google](http://www.google.com) is for :) Gosh I love the internet.

Here are some helpful links for folks if you have similar problems:
