Yesterday it was 51 degrees and the news predicted we'd get snow. I had my doubts, because it's not the first time they call for snow and we get nothing. I got up at 3am this morning, partially excited to see snow but it was nothing but rain, needless to say I was a bit disappointed. Imagine my surprise when I got up this morning to find several inches of snow, and it was still falling. \[gallery link="file"\]
