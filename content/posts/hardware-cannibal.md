As you know my cubie went off to greener pastures, so I cannibalized his side of the cube. I took his dual 19" [Dell](http://www.dell.com) [1905FP](http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/dell-ultrasharp-1905fp/4505-3174_7-31232074.html) LCDs and his [Dell](http://www.dell.com) Optiplex dual [Xeon](http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/dell-ultrasharp-1905fp/4505-3174_7-31232074.html) workstation. I was really hesitant to give up my 22" Dell [P1130](http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/monitors/p1130/en/g_ug/specs.htm) CRTs which did 1600x1200 quite nicely for the measly 1280x1024 of the LCDs.  But I made the font smaller to regain some real estate on the screen :)  I would much prefer a nice [24" LCD](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19&sku=320-5647) or dual [20" LCDs](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19&sku=320-4687)  but beggars can't be choosy. My old workstation, a [pogolinux](http://www.pogolinux.com/) Altura [AMD64](http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_9485_9487,00.html?redir=CPAT01) 3200+ will remain as a test box.
