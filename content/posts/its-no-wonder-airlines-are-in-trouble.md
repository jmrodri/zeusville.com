It's 6:33pm CDT here in San Antonio, TX.  My flight to ATL which was supposed to leave at 6:26pm is now delayed until 8:06pm, which wouldn't be a huge problem if I didn't have a connection that is supposed to leave ATL at 10:30pm EDT to RDU.  So it looks like I will be spending my birthday in Atlanta instead of at home. What really gets me about all this is how the freakin arilines are having financial trouble, it's because their f\*\*\*ing service SUCKS! I mean delays, cancellations, extremely poor service, and the lack of actual food or care in the flights. So DON'T FLY DELTA AIRLINES! I won't even bother with a link to their site since they don't deserve the business.
