Almost two years ago, I was involved in the [open sourcing](https://www.redhat.com/archives/spacewalk-list/2008-June/msg00000.html) effort of Spacewalk. While I've moved on to other [projects](https://fedorahosted.org/candlepin/) since then, [Spacewalk](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/) still holds a special place in my heart.

Yesterday the Spacewalk team announced the release of version 1.0! This is an exciting milestone. Here's a summary of some of the things you'll find in 1.0.

![](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/attachment/wiki/WikiStart/spacewalk-1-0-release.png?format=raw)

**Features & Enhancements**

*   RHN Client code dropped HAL in favor of python-ugdev

*   New script to rename Spacewalk hostname

*   RHN Proxy migrated to mod\_wsgi

*   The Spacewalk java stack uses Tomcat 6 on Fedora 12

**Known Issues**

*   Provider GPG key is sometimes not recognized causing packages to show up as 'unknown Provider'

*   Still no PostgreSQL support. We need _**HELP**_ to move this forward.

Checkout the [OFFICIAL announcement: here.](https://www.redhat.com/archives/spacewalk-announce-list/2010-April/msg00000.html)

Congrats to the Spacewalk team for reaching this important milestone.

I think, it shouldn't reach 1.0 without PostgreSQL support. Open source solution can not rely on proprietary one. Shit happens. :(
