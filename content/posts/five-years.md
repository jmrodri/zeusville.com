Today marks my five year anniversary at [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com). Where I've been working on [Red Hat Network Satellite](http://www.redhat.com/red_hat_network/), and it's upstream open source project, [Spacewalk](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/). Here's to another five years or more! :)
