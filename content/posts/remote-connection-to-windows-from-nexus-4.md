I setup [Windows 7](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/home) running in a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) guest on my [CentOS 7](http://www.centos.org/) Linux server (mostly for doing taxes and having a Windows test machine). I've configured it to start headless, that is without a monitor on the server. My main means of connection is using [rdesktop](http://www.rdesktop.org/) from my [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) desktops. Tonight, I decided to see how smart my smartphone really is. Could I connect remotely to a Windows 7 box using a 4.7" Nexus 4 Android phone? The answer? YES! Using [RD Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.rdc.android&hl=en) I connected to the Windows machine and was able to interact with it. Is this a usable solution on such a small screen? No way. But if you need to access something you might be able to get around well enough to get what you want.

Any way, why did I do this? Because I can. Isn't technology fun?
