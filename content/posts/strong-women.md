My favorite dialog from [300](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/sparta/):

**Persian Messenger**: What makes this woman think she can speak among men?

**Gorgo**: Because only Spartan women give birth to real men.

I love that quote too! Also, I love that the Spartan women were portrayed as admiring their husbands' masculinity. John Bryan Stone
