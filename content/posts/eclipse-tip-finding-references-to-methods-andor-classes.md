I stumbled on a very cool feature in Eclipse "References". It allows you to find classes which **refer** to a particular method or class.

To invoke right-mouse click on a method name in a class, click References -> Project. It will display a Search tab with a list of all the classes and the methods which call the particular method you selected.

The same is true if you right-mouse click on a classname.
