Last night I attended the "Weblogs and Java" talk at the [Trijug](http://trijug.org/) by [Dave Johnson](http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/roller). It was a very interesting talk. I learned a lot about weblogs, how they could potentially fit in a corporate environment, and a little about architecture.
