The other night Adan was farting at the dinner table, he has a tendency to wait til the last minute to go to the bathroom. He let out a few, and I gave him a stern look. Adan said, "excuse me"

I asked, "do you have to go poopy?"

Adan replied, "would you be mad?" (since I have a tendency to get annoyed when their bodily functions get a nature call at the most inopportune (sp?) moment)

I replied, "no, just go." Adan gets up and walks to the bathroom, farting with every step. PFFOOOT!we were annoyed, but couldn't help but burst out into histerical laughter.
