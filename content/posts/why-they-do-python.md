Found this nugget while reading blogs this morning: [Python Experts - Why They Do Python](http://www.odinjobs.com/blogs/careers/entry/python_experts_why_they_do)

In the article they ask "What do you think is the most important feature of the Python language?" I'm surprised that the fact that white space is part of the language leading to more readable code was one of the strengths. When I first learned Python I hated the white space being part of the syntax. Coming from Java it seemed unnatural. But after a while it's a wonderful thing. It makes the code easier to read, I've become very fond of it.

My favorite response to the question was by Tim:

> It's pragmatic nature.. It doesn't try to be the coolest or most flexible or most 'enterprisey'. It gives the programmer a very predictable framework in which to ply their skills. In short it doesn't dictate or get in the way but does gently suggest that you could do better...

If you haven't played with Python, I urge you to give it a try. It's best to pick a project and try to do it in Python. You'll have to do more than one because at first the frustration will annoy you, especially if you're coming from Java. But after a bit of coding you'll wonder why you never moved to Python a long time ago. :)

Computers don't often make me happy. Python simply makes me happy. :) -todd

For me, it's about developer-performance/maintainability balance. Let's call this arbitary stat D\*M, and IMHO it drives everything. Java is marketed as very strong at the "M", but is said to be readable "like a phone book" and trying to get real work done is awkward, so it gets a low score for "D". Ruby/Perl is marked as very strong at the "D", but tends to degenerate in the "M". Python finds a good balance, and comes out ahead. Not that I always agree with him (and where is Arc anyway), but see also: http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html Given, C is always in the running for heavy lifting reasons, with any of the above, and can not be forgotten.
