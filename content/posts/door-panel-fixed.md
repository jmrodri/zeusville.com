Tonight I finally fixed the window in the Trans Am and replaced the door panel. The guide wheel came off the window when the metal on the window base broke. I had to fashion a new bracket to place the guide wheel on and screwed it to the window base. Here's my first prototype. The final one had the cut coming in from the right side instead of the bottom. Works great.

In the process, I actually locked the keys in the car. Yes, I know stupid. The door wasn't quite closed all the way, so I took a coat hanger bent the tip, and used it to push the power lock button. :)
