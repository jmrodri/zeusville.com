Sunday afternoon we toured the Annual Wake County [Parade of Homes](http://www.hbawake.com/about/2007-parade-of-homes). On the way out of one of the homes we saw this magnificent spider.

A little google reveals this is a [St. Andrews cross spider](http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/st_andrews_cross.htm).
