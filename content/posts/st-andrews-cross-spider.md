Sunday afternoon we toured the Annual Wake County [Parade of Homes](http://www.hbawake.com/about/2007-parade-of-homes).

On the way out of one of the homes we saw this magnificent spider.

I loved the zigzag web. A little google reveals this is a [St. Andrews cross spider](http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/st_andrews_cross.htm).

It's a yellow garden spider, relatively common: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argiope\_aurantia

Actually I think this is a related species - we usually have a couple in our back yard ever year: http://home.att.net/~larvalbugrex/argiope.html
