Today was [Kevin](http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/)'s last day. We've been cubies for almost 6 months now and I'll miss his sarcasm (though not the doom cloud he has over him) :)Â  Here are some of my favorite terms from the past 18 months:

*   leathah pants
*   freakin jackhole
*   look the po po is coming
*   stinklebell
*   flippin muppet
*   @$$hat
*   @$$taco
*   two stroke

There are probably many others, but those are the ones that just crack me up.
