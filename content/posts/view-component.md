As you may know, I'm working on my [first web application](http://www.jroller.com/page/jmrodri/20031114) and I'm going to choose Velocity as my view component. One of my co-workers pointed out the nice [VelocityLayoutServlet](http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/tools/view/layoutservlet.html). I've chosen Velocity because my pages will be quite simple with only a few items being auto generated. Plus having the templates be mostly HTML, I can have my wife edit the layout as she sees fit without having to learn messy JSP tags.

I will continue to post on my progress, which is going very slow lately.
