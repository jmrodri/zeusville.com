My favorite car of all time has always been the 1969 Chevy Camaro. I've always thought that the perfect car would be a first generation Camaro with today's engine technology and transmission. This new revival of the Camaro is an excellent rendition and one of the better retro cars available today. \[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="448" caption="2010 Chevrolet Camaro (Courtesy of autoblog.com)"\][![2010 Chevrolet Camaro](http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2008/07/production_2010_camaro_coupe_1280_-00.jpg)](http://www.autoblog.com/2008/07/18/2010-chevrolet-camaro-revealed/)\[/caption\]
