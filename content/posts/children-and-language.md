Today Adán watched ["The Fox and the Hound"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082406/). So Liz was trying to get him to say **fox** and in his little voice it came out **f\*\*k**. Adán recounted for me at dinner that he watched **f\*\*k** which made me laugh. My laughing caused him to repeat it, at which point I laughed even harder. When Liz tried to correct him, he responded, "No Mommy, f\*\*k". At this point we are all laughing hysterically.

my little boy used to watch his big brother play a game on the Nintendo where there was a character called Captain Falcon, whose signature move was the "Falcon Punch" accompanied by an eponymous yell... needless to say at MANY a playground he used to gleefully exclaim "F\*\*cken Punch" to anyone and everyone...

When my son was learning to speak the work "truck" came out as f\*\*k. My wife was driving around town with him when he saw a dump truck. He excitedly yelled "dum f\*\*k" over and over. My wife is still not sure how she stayed on the road while she laughed uncontrollably.
