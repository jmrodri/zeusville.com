Today Adán watched ["The Fox and the Hound"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082406/). So Liz was trying to get him to say **fox** and in his little voice it came out **f\*\*k**. Adán recounted for me at dinner that he watched **f\*\*k** which made me laugh. My laughing caused him to repeat it, at which point I laughed even harder. When Liz tried to correct him, he responded, "No Mommy, f\*\*k". At this point we are all laughing hysterically.
