Adán's ability to draw at the tender age of 2.5 is astonishing, at least to us. The other day he drew a person and I asked him who it was. He responded, "It's Adán". We were amazed.

No way. That is astonishing for a 2.5 year old. The biggest part is that he is drawing the little things like hands and feet (and fingers?). Our 3.5 year old has been doing this for a little while, and he is still ahead of the curve. My wife (MS in early childhood development) forced me into leaving this comment. She says "That kid is very smart!"

\[...\] Here is Anakin the other half of the duel with Obi-Wan. Keep in mind that Adan (my oldest son) is only 5 years old. But he’s always been a good artist, just check out his self-portrait when he was 2.5 years old: self ortrait \[...\]
