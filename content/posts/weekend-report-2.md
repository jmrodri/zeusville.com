This weekend we threw both the boys a birthday party in Maryland. We drove up Thursday night (left Wake Forest @ 10pmish) to avoid Friday traffic. We threw the boys a [Star Wars](http://www.starwars.com/) themed birthday party complete with the boys dressed as Obi-Wan and Anakin. They made lightsabers, musical asteroid where you pass an asteroid (ball of foil) around until the music stops whoever is holding the ball gets to unwrap a layer and take a prize, a Darth Vader pi√±ata, dark vs light cake (chocolate and yellow cake layers), and much more.

The boys absolutely loved the party. They stayed up until 10pm. Marco had such a dirty face that pretty much stated "this is a face that had a lot of fun today". They also made out like bandits in the Star Wars toy department, from ships to figures to Transformers. My favorites (yes I'm a big kid too) are the ships:
