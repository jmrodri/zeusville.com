So why is the maven command abbreviated to mvn.  I find it hard to type mvn than maven.  And are we developers too lazy to type 5 characters?

An HCI study published in 1982, conducted by Weissman and Bates showed that the utility of a program is proportianally inverse to the length of its command name. You can see examples of this in every day life. For instance, cd is used frequently, and is quite useful. On the other hand, bonobo-activation-run-query is rarely used, if ever.

Insightful point Mr. Bowes, I can honestly say I've never run bonobo-activation-run-query, not once. I use cd hundreds of times a day, there can be no other explanation.
