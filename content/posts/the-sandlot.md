This weekend the boys and I watched [The Sandlot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108037/). Baseball is a wonderful sport. It is slow paced, relaxing, and means summer is here.

My father loves baseball, and one of the things I always remember him saying to me was that he was upset that the Washington Senators left Washington in 1971 -- the year I was born. He did manage to take us to see the [Baltimore Orioles](http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=bal)on numerous occasions.

I have continued the Rodriguez tradition by taking my boys to baseball games in summer. Two of the past three years I had [Durham Bulls](http://www.durhambulls.com/) mini-plans. I think this year I will get a mini-plan to the [Carolina Mudcats](http://www.gomudcats.com/) since the boys had so much fun there last year.
