It has been a really rough week. Last weekend, Adan got sick with flu-like symptoms: fever and coughing. Liz took him to the doctor's on Monday where they did every kind of test and determined it was viral. So Adan was out of school Monday & Tuesday. Then Tuesday night I had a fever and felt under the weather too. Wednesday night, Liz had a fever and was knocked off her feet all day Thursday. Then last night, Marco woke up twice and was burning up with fever. :(  Iliana has had a runny nose the entire time as well. I feel better today, but still rather, shall I say, phlegmy :)  But should be back in the office on Monday. Thankfully I was able to work from home to avoid contaminating my co-workers, and being able to take care of the family. On a happier note, Liz & I celebrated our 8th wedding anniversary on Tuesday.  Happy Anniversary!
