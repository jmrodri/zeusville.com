Toot, toot, toot. This is the one thing that Fedora and Red Hat engineers don't do enough of. We all want to know the great things people do and the only way to find out is if they tell us ;-)

I read the article this morning in RH Magazine, and as soon as I have time I'll give a try to zmugfs. Thanks! btw: any plan to package it for F8 ?

Rock on. I suppose I should play with it. I have been musing on an article about Fuse-EncFs based on this:http://www.dma.org/~tw/howtos/howto-encrypt-a-filesystem-with-fuse-encfs.html Just haven't gotten around to it. Congrats. You are a published author. -todd
