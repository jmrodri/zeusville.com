Google released [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/). Though they only have Windows clients available. But Linux users are not left out. Using [GAIM](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/index.php) you can chat with other Google talk users.

While there's a lot of excitement over the new Google Talk, it's just a [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org/) server with all the [gmail](http://gmail.google.com) accounts registered to it.

But they were kind enough to document the steps to connect using GAIM [here](http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=24073).
