As a car and movie fanatic, I can't wait to take the kids to see ["Speed Racer"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_racer). They're trying to make [the movie](http://www.collider.com/entertainment/news/article.asp/aid/5290/tcid/1) [Rated G](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system) which is great. They're also using a [special type of camera](http://www.collider.com/entertainment/news/article.asp/aid/5290/tcid/1) that will make the background and foreground in focus like a cartoon.

So far the Mach 5 looks awesome:
