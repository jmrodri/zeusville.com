Mostly a note to myself, but others might find them useful.

### Use of Go articles

Here are some articles of companies using Go [Go After 2 years in production](https://www.iron.io/go-after-2-years-in-production/) [Building Web Apps with Go](https://www.gitbook.com/book/codegangsta/building-web-apps-with-go/details) [Companies using Go](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers) [Go at Heroku](https://blog.golang.org/go-at-heroku) [Handling five billion sessions a day – in real time](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/handling-five-billion-sessions-a-day-in-real-time) [Open Sourcing Our Go Libraries](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2014/07/open-sourcing-our-go-libraries/) [The March towards Go](http://zef.me/blog/6191/the-march-towards-go) [How we went from 30 Servers to 2: Go](https://www.iron.io/how-we-went-from-30-servers-to-2-go/) [OpenShift 3 and Go: Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/birthday-bash-2014/openshift-3-old-dogs-new-tricks/)

### Node.js to Go

I found quite a few articles where folks were using Node.js and moved to Go. [A closer look at Go and Node.JS](https://www.conetix.com.au/blog/a-closer-look-at-go-and-nodejs) [Making the Switch from Node.js to Golang](http://blog.digg.com/post/141552444676/making-the-switch-from-nodejs-to-golang) [Farewell Node.js](https://medium.com/@tjholowaychuk/farewell-node-js-4ba9e7f3e52b#.xpdapsuvp) [From Node.js to Go, Why One Startup Made The Switch](http://thenewstack.io/from-node-js-to-go-why-one-startup-made-the-switch/) [Node.js vs Golang: Battle of the Next-Gen Languags](http://www.hostingadvice.com/blog/nodejs-vs-golang/)

### Go web frameworks

Since web apps are the thing these days, it's a good idea to look at web frameworks for Go. [Gorilla web toolkit](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/) [Beego Quickstart](http://beego.me/docs/quickstart/) [Go kit - distributed programming toolkit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) [Revel web framework](https://revel.github.io/) [IRIS Web Framework](http://iris-go.com/) [A Survey of 5 Go Web Frameworks](http://thenewstack.io/a-survey-of-5-go-web-frameworks/) [Making a RESTful JSON API in Go](http://thenewstack.io/make-a-restful-json-api-go/) [Key/value logs in Go](http://techno-weenie.net/2013/11/2/key-value-logs-in-go/) [How We Moved Our API From Ruby to Go and Saved Our Sanity](http://blog.parse.com/learn/how-we-moved-our-api-from-ruby-to-go-and-saved-our-sanity/) If you have a framework, article, or comparison you'd like to share, leave me a comment.
