Testing out the [lekhonee](https://fedorahosted.org/lekhonee/) GNOME frontend for [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com). The UI seems pretty barebones and not very GNOME-ish, but it is functional. Check out the screenshot below: [![](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/lekhonee.png)](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/lekhonee.png) Thanks [Kushal](http://kushaldas.in/). P.S. this entry was written entirely in [lekhonee](https://fedorahosted.org/lekhonee/), well ALMOST. I couldn't figure out how to upload the screenshot without using the Wordpress webui. The post is bought to you by [lekhonee](http://fedorahosted.org/lekhonee) v0.4
