Dude.. HP scanners suck.. In fact just about everything IMHO from HP sucks. They screwed me over on driver support for a scanner and printer once. Since that time I haven't purchased one HP product. I have Cannon LiDE 30 scanner ($50) that doesn't even need a power cable (uses power from USB) and it works great. A little slow, but the quality of the scans are pretty good. For printers I normally stick with Epson. I just bought an R300 a few months ago. It works great as well. -Pierce
