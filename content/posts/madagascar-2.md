Grandpop and I took the boys to the movies to see "[Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa](http://www.madagascarmovie.com/?gclid=CP2Pnq_K5pYCFRQhnAodYGsiPg)". The movie was quite entertaining and I think they did a good job picking up where they left off. The boys were laughing hysterically. It helps a sequel when the original actors are also in it. All of the character voices returned: Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Chris Rock, and Sascha Baron Cohen. If you have kids I recommend it.
