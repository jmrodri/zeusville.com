Flipping channels, I stopped by FOX News to see what trash they were talking about tonight. The O'Reilly Factor was on, and this is what he said on the 'Talking Points' segment:

> "Great Britain is a quasi-nanny state. They have free health care, generous pensions, and safety nets all over the place, yet their society is on fire. No question that is a warning to us." -- Bill O'Reilly on The O'Reilly Factor.

Really Bill? So if the United States gets free health care and other safety nets we're doomed to burn? Ugh is this the trash you spread on your show? Seriously?
