How about that: ``vij() { vim `find . -name "$1" -print` }`` This will open all the files and you can use :n and :prev to navigate forward and backwards.

This is awesome. I've had the exact same script as your original version for years (except for emacs and I called it "femacs") but I never looked into fixing the multiple file issue. I'd just watch as they all popped up. I have to give this a try.

When I initially commented I seem to have clicked on the -Notify me when new comments are added- checkbox and now every time a comment is added I receive 4 emails with the same comment. Is there a way you are able to remove me from that service? Kudos!
