Daylight Savings Time is such a waste of time. I really don't understand the purpose of it anymore. If you know please respond via comments.

And what happens with the TV when the clocks go back an hour at 2am on Sunday morning. If you were watching a 2 hour moving that started at 1am will it now end at 2am? And in the Spring what happens with the extra hour? Enquiring minds want to know.
