We had our own family Super Bowl party. We made a bunch of finger food: mozzarella sticks, wings, and other things.Â  I wanted the NY Giants to win even though they knocked out my favorite team, the Dallas Cowboys. But the New England has been annoying me all year so, it was nice to see them lose :)
