Since the default Netgear firmware doesn't have DNS built in, I flashed the [WNDR3700](http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Netgear_WNDR3700)

with dd-wrt. But I was thoroughly disappointed with the performance even after following the settings from the wiki for the [Atheros](http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Atheros/ath_wireless_settings) wireless settings.

**netgear wireless n (5Ghz) 2ft ddwrt**

78.2539s

6.9 MB/s

55.2Mbps

**netgear wireless n (2.4Ghz) 2ft ddwrt**

61.0922s

8.8 MB/s

70.4Mbps

**netgear wireless n (5Ghz) 2ft ddwrt turbo mode**

51.4871s

10.4MB/s

**83.2Mbps**

**netgear wireless n (5Ghz) 2ft ddwrt turbo mode + tuning**

52.51s

10.2MB/s

81.6Mbps

**netgear wireless n (5Ghz) downstairs ddwrt turbo mode + tuning**

272.237s

2.0MB/s

16.0Mbps

**netgear wireless n (2.4Ghz) downstairs ddwrt turbo mode + tuning**

226.537s

2.4MB/s

**19.2Mbps**

Clearly the **tuning** didn't actually help, and the fastest I could get was 83.2Mbps but I got 123.2Mbps with the stock firmware. I reset the router back to factory defaults and was able to get 104.8Mbps which is still slower than it was before but it's way better than dd-wrt.

This is definitely disappointing since I had such great success with [Tomato](http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato) firmware on my WRT54G.

you might wanna check openwrt. the guy hacking for atheros/qualcomm on ath9k is maintaining lots of stuff there.

Wireless being a 'switchless' technology is going to see inconsistent speed issues depending on multiple factors: 1) Slowest system on network can affect speed for all other systems 2) Conflicting frequencies can affect speed due to retransmits 3) Various buffer-bloat items so that certain traffic gets high throughput for a short while but much slower throughput long ter,

It looks like your testing of dd-wrt was only ever w/ 40mhz (turbo)... how was the stock firmware configured? Did it use 20/40, 20, or 40mhz? That can really make a difference depending upon how much interference you're getting...
