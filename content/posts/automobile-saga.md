The Trans Am is having more issues, expected since the car is 12 years old and has 139,000 miles on it.  I believe one of the fans (it has dual fans) is failing to kick on which causes the car to almost overheat when stopped, the A/C is busted again, probably due to the fans not working properly, the driver's side door panel is off because the window came unhinged from the guide rails, front passenger fender has a crack in it, the leather seats are getting split because of worn and dry leather, and finally (at least from what I can tell) the car has a very rough idle.  I suspect it's time for a new [Optispark](http://www.google.com/search?q=optispark&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) distributor.
