I intended to replace our [Linksys WRT54g](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series) with the [Netgear N600 WNDR3700v2](http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/high-performance/WNDR3700.aspx) but I didn't have the [success I wanted with dd-wrt](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/netgear-n600-wndr3700v2-and-dd-wrt/) and the stock firmware doesn't offer the features like DNS, static DHCP, etc that [Tomato](http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato) and [dd-wrt](http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index) have.

I asked myself "where do we use the wireless the most?" The answer is downstairs. I decided to host the Netgear router downstairs in the home theater cabinet. Finally I turned off the wireless on the WRT54g and keeping it as our router. Now the Mac Book Pro and the Thinkpad get **104+Mbps** vs the 5Mbps I was getting before.
