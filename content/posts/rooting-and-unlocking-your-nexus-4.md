I used this link: http://forum.xda-developers.com/printthread.php?t=2266654 and used the SuperSU 1.6.5 from Chainfire. http://download.chainfire.eu/351/SuperSU/UPDATE-SuperSU-v1.65.zip Good luck. It's worth it, should be the damn default or they should make it possible to backup your device FULLY without it.
