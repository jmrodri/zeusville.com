I used this link: http://forum.xda-developers.com/printthread.php?t=2266654 and used the SuperSU 1.6.5 from Chainfire. http://download.chainfire.eu/351/SuperSU/UPDATE-SuperSU-v1.65.zip

Good luck. It's worth it, should be the damn default or they should make it possible to backup your device FULLY without it.

I did this as soon as I got the phone, but I'm finding now that the OTA updates aren't working. I'll have to look at what the update is trying to do and see if I can figure out why it's failing.
