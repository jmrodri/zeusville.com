I decided to join the legions moving to [github.com](http://github.com), I moved my projects, [sm-photo-tool](http://github.com/jmrodri/sm-photo-tool/tree/master) and [zmugfs](http://github.com/jmrodri/zmugfs/tree/master), from sourceforge.net to github.com. The clean interface on github.com is awesome and the whole social networking aspect about it is very appealing. If you haven't moved to [git](http://git-scm.com/) give [github.com](http://github.com) a try.
