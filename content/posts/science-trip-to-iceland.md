I know that many of you are already tapped out with donations because of the recent world events. I've held off making this post because of that, but the boys have asked if I've shared their letter on my social media to help them raise money for their trip next year. Below you will find Marco and Adan's letter. Thanks for taking the time to look over their letter.

Hello everyone it’s Marco Rodriguez, hope everything is going well!

My brother, Adan, and I were given the opportunity to go to Iceland for a

week as a trip for our school. This is an amazing opportunity, but

unfortunately, we currently cannot afford to pay for the entire trip in the

time given without spending more money than we should. We humbly request

that anyone reading this would consider donating a little bit of money

towards the trip to allow us to go have the trip of a lifetime.

For anyone willing to donate (remember every dollar counts so no need to

donate lots of money if it is not convenient), you can donate on the

online donation site. We each have our own link to our trip.

[Donate to Marco](http://personal.eftours.com/secure/make-donation.aspx?poid=D3E3327D&utm_medium=web&utm_source=paxsecure&utm_campaign=fundraising)

[Donate to Adan](http://personal.eftours.com/secure/make-donation.aspx?poid=D3E33273&utm_medium=web&utm_source=paxsecure&utm_campaign=fundraising)

Click the links above and it will take you to the donation site (\*Note: all funds donated on the

website will go directly towards the payment for the trip).

This trip package includes:

\* Round-trip flights on a major carrier

\* Comfortable motorcoach

\* 4 overnight stays in hotels with private bathrooms

\* Breakfast and dinner daily

\* Full-time Tour Director

\* 1 sightseeing tour led by your Tour Director & 3 walking tours

\* **Entrances:** National Museum \* Skógarfoss Folk Museum \* Blue Lagoon

\* **Experiential learning:** Thingvellir National Park geology walk \* Greenhouse visit \* Thorvaldseyri Farm

\* **Optional:** Glacier Walk

Any payments are due by February 2018. As you can probably tell this is a great opportunity for

me and my brother and we would love to go, and any donations would be much

appreciated. We would be departing on the trip in March 2018

Hope everyone has a great day!

Thank you,

Marco & Adan
