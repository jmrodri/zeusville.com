Resetting the BIOS to default values seemed to fix the mup.sys error during boots. This is odd since I just finished flashing the BIOS. Oh well. On to the next problem.

50 bucks says you'll have to reinstall.

At least if you put them on Linux, you could ssh to fix the problem (given no network issues of course.) For what they use the computer for is it feasible? You could always do a trial run using the FC6 live CD...

I have been extremely reluctant to move people to Linux. I just don't want to help them over the learning curve. With windows I just tell them to "go away" since I haven't played with windows in over 10 years now. :) You could convince them to \*buy\* RHEL so that you put the burden on Red Hat's support system. :) -todd
