When I was in college I was stunned by a fellow students answer to my question, "Why are you studying Computer Science?". His answer was "Because the money is good", not because he liked or was interested in computers. The other day I got the same reaction from some of my co-workers. They were in the tech industry because the pay is good.

You could say I chose to study Computer Science partially because of the money, but that came after I realized how much fun computers and writing software can be. Also, it was one of the few courses which I got good grades in as opposed to the other majors I tried (Architecture, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Mathematics (ok I only thought about majoring in Math)).

I think part of the problem with the tech industry today is that it's full of wanna be programmers, notice I didn't say Software Engineers or Computer Scientests. There are many folks out there who want a quick buck, but don't give a rats @$$ about computers or their software. I for one, want to be the best Software Engineer I can be, and would prefer to work with folks who also want to be the best Engineers (or Scientests). People who want to constantly learn new technologies, grow both professionally and personally, and not to simply make more money.

Now I wouldn't give up my salary, at least not now. But if you asked me would you rather get a raise and continue working on boring stuff, or would you rather learn something new and contribute to the software community. I'd choose the latter. I don't believe many in our industry would.

One of my favorite quotes is by Picard:

"The aquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives.  
We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity."

\- Jean Luc Picard, Star Trek: First Contact    

My question to my readers, why are you in the tech industry?
