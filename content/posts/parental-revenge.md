As a parent of 3, I can only imagine what my wife goes through when she tells me "I went to the grocery store today." Though we only have 3, I suppose the trip is a lot like [this woman's trip](http://cgi.ebay.com/LOT-OF-POKEMON-CARDS-THAT-MY-KIDS-TRIED-TO-SNEAK-BY-ME_W0QQitemZ130144061675QQihZ003QQcategoryZ60238QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem) to the grocery store. She's selling a pack of POKEMON cars on ebay, the story is HILARIOUS (except to mother's that have gone grocery shopping with more than 2 children) :)

This mother has a blog too: [http://mom2my6pack.blogspot.com/](http://mom2my6pack.blogspot.com/)
