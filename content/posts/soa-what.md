It seems that this is the year of SOA. Maybe I'm just not a visionary any more, but I don't get the the whole buzz behind SOA. It feels like a reinvention of CORBA, except instead of writing IDL, we're writing XML (SOAP in particular).

While I believe that SOA does have a purpose, I think we're looking to find a problem to solve using SOA. I like to think that we as engineers have problems that need solving and not just using the technology du jour.

I guess the thing that bothers me most about SOA is just the buzzword not the actual

architecture.

Cannot agree more. For me SOA is something like WEB 2.0, only little bit more concrete. A composition of already know technologies bundled in new box...
