Hi, I was able to get Firefox working with Creator by: 1. Main Menu: Tools/Options 2. Click System Settings on the left 3. Click Web Browser on the right and select Mozilla 4. Expand the Web Browsers node on the left 5. Select Mozilla child node of Web Browsers 6. On the right click the "..." button and edit to point to your Firefox executeable.
