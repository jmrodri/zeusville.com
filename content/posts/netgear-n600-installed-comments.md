Felix, no I didn't try OpenWRT. After I went back to stock firmware and decided to put the router downstairs, I didn't see the need. Maybe if I get bored again I'll give it shot.

Have you tried using OpenWRT instead? For me it has great performance and one of the lead developers is a developer of ath9k, too. So it's highly optimized for these kind of devices. I use it on my D-Link DIR-825, which hardware-wise is almost the same as the WNDR3700 (I just thought the possibility of installing external antennas to the DIR-825 was more appealing :)).
