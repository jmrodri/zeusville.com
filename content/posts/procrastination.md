I'm doing our 2006 taxes tonight using [TaxCut](http://www.taxcut.com/) for [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com) running inside [VMware Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/) 5.5 on [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/) Core 6 [x86\_64](http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/6/x86_64/iso/).

I hate Windows, so next year I might opt for doing the taxes online using [TaxCut's online service](http://www.taxcut.com/products/2006/online/premiumbundle.html).

Ok, I really need to get back to the taxes, that's it for now.
