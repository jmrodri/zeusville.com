One of my favorite new shows on [TLC](http://tlc.discovery.com/) is [Overhaulin](http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/overhaulin/overhaulin.html). So if I ever got overhauled, this is what I'd like done to the [Bird](http://jroller.com/page/jmrodri/20040815).

1\. Replace stock T/A hood with a Ram Air hood.
2\. Rebuild the LT-1 V8 engine preferably increase the horsepower from 275 to >300.
3\. Replace the wheels with 17" 5 spoke rims (like to keep it stock as possible)
4\. Replace the Kumho 245/50ZR16 with some [Yokohama AVS Sport](http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Yokohama&tireModel=AVS+Sport&vehicleSearch=false&partnum=74WR7AVSS&fromCompare1=yes) (they're the closests to the Firstone SZ50s I used to have)
5\. Replace stock exhaust with a [Borla](http://www.borla.com/automotive/?make=PONTIAC&vehicle=TRANS+AM&model=5.7L+V8+AT%2FMT&year=1993-95) exhaust.
6\. Lower the cars ride height by an inch or two using Eibach springs and new performance shocks
7\. Add a strut tower brace
8\. To stiffen the body a bit, sub frame connectors
9\. Re-upholster the interior with new leather, preferably removing the plastic backings of the front seats
10\. Add a 10-disc CD changer, and integrate my current stereo with the steering wheel controls (again)
11\. Replace the panhard rod, and the rear arms

That should about do it.

I only watch it when it has be Tivo'd. I dont like the stupid acting the guy and girl do to "steal" the cars. I also like the great biker build off, and Monter Garage. I have not seen the new episode of Motorcycle Mania. Kid Rock is supposed to be on with Jesse James. Maybe it is later this month yet...

I forgot one more thing. Instead of rebuilding the motor. Drop in a Banks twin turbo. Gene Banks was on an episode of Horsepower TV and his crate motors with twin turbos turn out 1,100 HP. The single turbos turn out 600HP.
