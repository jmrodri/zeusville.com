I'm curious, why is Oracle not an option for you guys where it's not? It only uses the freeware version of Oracle, no?

Thank you guys! I'm waiting PostgreSQL support to introduce spacewalk in my company, because I have no chances of success with the Oracle dependency :( Keep on rocking.

Great news. Kudos and many thanks to all the developers! Same as Juanjo I'm looking forward to PostgreSQL support as Oracle is not an option in the environment I work in. Keep up the great work and relentless progress in the PostgreSQL area :-)
