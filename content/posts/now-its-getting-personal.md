On Saturday July 10th, I called Time Warner tech support to debug a switched digital video problem. After a reboot message was sent, I was transferred to TiVo support. TiVo walked me through a few things and determined that I needed a new tuning adapter. I call Time Warner again, but switched to online chat to avoid the 20 minute hold time. Here's a

snippet of the transcript:

```


jesus\_:    I called tech support earlier today

jesus\_:    they sent a reboot signal to it

jesus\_:    then forwarded me to TiVo tech support

jesus\_:    we spent about an hour on the phone trying various reboots and disconnections

jesus\_:    none worked.

jesus\_:    TiVo support said I needed a new tuning adapter. and I contacted the TWCableHelp folks on twitter.com

jesus\_:    they said the Raleigh office said I needed a service call to have a tech come out \*WITH\* a tuning adapter

Shayne Norway:    I apologize for the inconvenience.

Shayne Norway:    I would be happy to assist you.

Shayne Norway:    Yes, that is correct a service call is needed.

jesus\_:    so that's what I want to do. I want to have a tech come out with a tuning adapter (please don't send out a tech without one that has happened 3 times already when I was having CableCARD issues).

jesus\_:    CableCARD seems to be working (thankfully)

Shayne Norway:    I can arrange a technician to visit your place on Monday  between 1 pm to 3 pm. Will that work for you?

jesus\_:    I prefer mornings, but if that is the earliest that is fine.

Shayne Norway:    That is earliest possible.

Shayne Norway:    Can I book it?

jesus\_:    yes

jesus\_:    Please ensure that he bring a tuning adapter. I don't want a repeat of the CableCARD fiasco.

Shayne Norway:    Yes, I have mentioned a note on your account.

Turns out the appointment was scheduled for TUESDAY not Monday as the above states. So I lost the afternoon, but got a credit for that miscommunication. 

Today (Tuesday) tech #6 shows up **WITHOUT** a tuning adapter, spends 3 hours! Trying everything he could to make up for the fact that he

didn't have a tuning adapter. He even called in a maintenance tech to look at the line that comes to the street (before it comes in to my house). He finally determined that my

tuning adapter is bad. **NO SHIT SHERLOCK I ALREADY TOLD YOU GUYS THIS!** Next available appointment? SATURDAY! 

I tried to get a credit for the rest of the week but Time Warner's systems don't allow that, so I have to wait until Saturday to get service credit for the whole week.

Time to update my BBB, NCDOJ, and FCC complaints with the latest news.
