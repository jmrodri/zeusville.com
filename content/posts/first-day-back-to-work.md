Today was my first day back to work.  I'm working from home this week to ease the transition of new baby and our normal lives again. I had quite a few emails, but I managed to keep up with them over the past 2 weeks.  Our release progressed without me which is no surprise because our team ROCKS! I started going through my list of bugzillas, to see where is a good starting point for the week. I'll be back in the office next week full force into the fray.
