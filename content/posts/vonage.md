I've had [Vonage](http://www.vonage.com) for several months as a second line to try out VoIP. On June 8th, I decided to make the commitment and started my number transfer. Typically it takes 20 days, but my current landline provider was dragging their feet, so much for being a _[Sprinter](http://www.sprint.com)_.

Well today 8/2/05, my number transfer has been completed. And I can get rid of my ridiculously priced landline.

If you're thinking of going VoIP, give [Vonage](https://subscribe.vonage.com/vonage-subscribe/index.htm) a try.

While you had dual phones, were you able to have the vonage line in your same calling area?

Yes, when I signed up for Vonage, I was able to choose a number in the same calling area.
