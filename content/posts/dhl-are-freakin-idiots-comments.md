I had the same problem with FedEx once. It was a Saturday and they couldn't find my place. Funny thing was is that they were just at my place 2 days earlier. When I called dispatch, they said it was because they have different drivers on the weekend. I politely explained that it doesn't matter who's driving the truck, my place is always at the same spot on the map.
