I went to [Staples](http://www.staples.com) today to buy a new scanner, the [HP ScanJet 4670](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/ho/WF06b/15179-64195-215155-15202-f25-303640-303642-303643.html) vertical scanner. They had a great price. The scanner was $199.99 (retail) with a $30 instant rebate making it $169.99. The cheapest I found online was $178. So with tax (7% here in NC) it came out to $181.99 and no waiting for shipping.

Now for the bad part. I got it home, I installed the software which went fine. I hooked up the scanner to the computer and couldn't scan. Windows XP didn't even see it. The HP software couldn't find the scanner either. I noticed the power light was off. So I hit the power button. Nothing happened. "Hmmm", I thought. (ok that's not what I really thought it was more like this piece of !@#%!@&#%!@(%^!@&#%^!@(\*^ ). I thought it was the plug or something. So I moved it to another outlet and VIOLA power. I went to touch the scanner and no power. Once again stumped. I touched the power cable and again power. I realized that if I moved the power cable around the scanner would go on and off. Now that was annoying a short in the cable. Normally, I would attempt to fix this, but having just bought it today, it's going back tomorrow.

Once I get the new one installed I'll give a full review. I will only connect it to my wife's Windows XP machine. I won't bother trying to make Linux work with it. Not worth the hassle.
