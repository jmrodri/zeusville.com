I've been running Fedora 13 beta on my laptop for quite a while. But I haven't been able to figure out what causes this scenario. It happens after a suspend/resume cycle. The battery popup clearly shows 7 hours + remaining, but the percentage and the icon are completely wrong.

Running acpi yields more accurate information:

```
\[jesusr@speed3 ~\]$ acpi -b

Battery 0: Discharging, 81%, 06:25:37 remaining

and acpitool shows the following:

```


\[jesusr@speed3 ~\]$ acpitool -B

  Battery #1     : present

    Remaining capacity : 7479 mAh, 81.01%, 07:09:00

    Design capacity    : 9324 mAh

    Last full capacity : 9232 mAh, 99.01% of design capacity

    Capacity loss      : 0.9867%

    Present rate       : 1046 mA

    Charging state     : discharging

    Battery type       : rechargeable 

    Model number       : 42T4799

    Serial number      :  6034

Could it be we have the decimal point in the wrong place? Seems like it should be 82% in the screenshot instead of 8.2%. Has this bug been fixed? If not, what package should I file the bug against? If you need a test user I'll be happy to test it :)
