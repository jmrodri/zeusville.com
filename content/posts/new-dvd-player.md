Our SONY DVP-NS315 DVD player died. We were noticing a lot of DVDs from [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com) that didn't play. Though they were scratched, they should have played. Today we put in two of the kids movies which were practically new, but they didn't play. After 3 movies that we know played yesterday, I called the time of death 11:30am.

We bought a new Sony DVP-NS77H/B which is an upconversion DVD player with an HDMI connection. It still has component and s-video which is what I need for our regular Sony TV. But when we get our HDTV, I'll be ready.

It's a tough place to be right now. The format wars for HD-DVD vs Sony Blu-Ray aren't over yet. Even upconverted DVDs top out at 420p (enhanced).
