After 10+ years of working with Java, I spent the last year working with Ruby & Rails. Let's just say I'm not a fan. I wanted to learn something new and I've heard a lot of good things about [Go](https://golang.org/). Quite a few projects use Go: [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker), [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus), and many more. Three weeks ago, I picked up a copy of ["The Go Programming Language"](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00) by Donovan & Kernighan. Yes, the same Kernighan that co-wrote the famous, ["The C Programming Language"](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0). In order to learn it, I needed a real life scenario, I needed a project. Why not port, [sm\_photo\_tool](https://github.com/jmrodri/sm-photo-tool), my [Smugmug](https://www.smugmug.com/) command line tool from [python](https://www.python.org/) to Go lang? That will give me experience with how Go handles parsing arguments, classes, REST APIs, concurrent uploads, and a bunch more things.  It's the perfect project to learn Go. In the next post I'll talk about structs in Go.
