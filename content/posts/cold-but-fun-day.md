Today was a cold but fun day. We started the day with Iliana's 8:30am softball game (they won 8-5). Adan had a pitching lesson at 10:45am where he has improved his fastball and change up pitches. He worked on his curve and some pickoff move all while battling cold, wind and what felt like a sandstorm from the field. Home for about 2 hours to eat lunch and warm up before heading out again, this time for Marco's 2:30 soccer game. The won that game 5-1 with some outstanding ball movement. Still frozen, we weren't done yet. Off to Marco's baseball game. His team won that game, but the best part was Marco hit a SOLO HOME RUN over the centerfield fence. It was AWESOME! We finished the evening with dinner at Chipotle and watched Star Wars the Force Awakens when we got home.
