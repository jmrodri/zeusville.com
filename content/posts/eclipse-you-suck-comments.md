I tried entering both swt.browser lines in my eclipse.ini. I have ADT installed in /opt/adt-bundle-linux-x86\_64-20131030. I added those 2 lines to /opt/adt-bundle-linux-x86\_64-20131030/eclipse/eclipse.ini

I am running ADT on Fedora 20 KDE and there are two bugs that I have encountered. One is solved by changing gtk+ theme from oxygen-gtk to any other theme. And second one that you have encountered is solved by using the eclipse.ini command you mentioned in the post. \`\`\` -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=mozilla \`\`\`

I'm running eclipse and ADT on FC20 with gnome3 without any problems. It wasn't a clean install though, The last clean install I did was about FC16.

Hi, I've a similar segment fault in FC19 with a clear Eclipse 3.7 and 4.2. I've solved adding this two lines inside eclipse.ini -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=mozilla -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=/opt/xulrunner-17.0.1 As you notice I've also downloaded and used xulrunner 17. More recent versions dosn't solve the fault.
