While watching the Daily Show one night, I found a new show on Comedy Central called "[Lil' Bush](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/lil_bush/index.jhtml?sicontent=0&sicreative=652783000&siclientid=1838&sitrackingid=7905120&gclid=CIKl9oyyjo0CFSOPgQodiFL8ng)". It's hilarious. The first episode I saw was about George turning gay because he was hanging out with a Brit, Tony Blair. And in the second 15 minute episode, he hires an illegal alien to do his chores.
