The tech industry is overflowing with buzzwords. I'm not sure if other industries are the same, but I know I am inundated with buzzwords on a daily basis, sometimes to the point of exhaustion.

[George Carlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin), one of my favorite comedians, has his ["Seven dirty words"](http://www.google.com/search?q=carlin+7+dirty+words&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) so I figured I'd list the seven dirty buzzwords I can do without for quite some time.

3.  platform

6.  pluggable (plugins)

9.  enterprise

12.  scalability (scalable)

15.  high availability

18.  extensibility

21.  architecture

If I never hear the above words again it wouldn't bother me in the least. And you may notice I avoided the acronym hell that [JEE](http://mindprod.com/jgloss/j2ee.html#COMPONENTS) (yes I'm using one of them) puts you through, that's a much longer list.

And what if you are not a native speaker? ""Availability" has been around for years. The real art is in "rely on", where motors rely on wind power and the boss relies on his secretary and a country relies on imports.

My personal favorite: "robust". Wanna-be managers and MBAs love this one.

\> And what if you are not a native speaker? Bingo. What are buzzwords? Short encapsulations of an idea to dispense with explaining the same thing over and over and over again. They are a type of idiom. We can get tired of idioms. We can hate them. We can list them as, "100 phrases to erase in 2008." What we cannot do is live without them. When you understand an idiom, you understand something deeper than the words themselves. You can convey a richer meaning. Modern business is multi-cultural and multi-lingual. Each culture/language has its own idioms. Business has its own idioms, called 'buzzwords'. Some of them definitely deserve death. But unfortunately, none of the ones on your list. What I do heartily agree with is the 'overflowing' idea. Idiom/buzzword abuse leads to trouble; it's why we speak more plainly and with as few cultural idioms as we can when we talk with people who are not native speakers.
