The tech industry is overflowing with buzzwords. I'm not sure if other industries are the same, but I know I am inundated with buzzwords on a daily basis, sometimes to the point of exhaustion. [George Carlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin), one of my favorite comedians, has his ["Seven dirty words"](http://www.google.com/search?q=carlin+7+dirty+words&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) so I figured I'd list the seven dirty buzzwords I can do without for quite some time.

1.  platform
2.  pluggable (plugins)
3.  enterprise
4.  scalability (scalable)
5.  high availability
6.  extensibility
7.  architecture

If I never hear the above words again it wouldn't bother me in the least. And you may notice I avoided the acronym hell that [JEE](http://mindprod.com/jgloss/j2ee.html#COMPONENTS) (yes I'm using one of them) puts you through, that's a much longer list.
