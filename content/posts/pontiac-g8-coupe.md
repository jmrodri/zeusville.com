[edmunds InsideLine](http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=125393?tid=edmunds.il.home.photopanel..1.*#3) reports the possibility of a Pontiac G8 coupe. This is one kick ass car. And I think I actually like the Orange color.

I also agree with the editors comments "**What this means to you:** We don't care if they call it GTO or Firebird or Powder Puff. We still want this Corvette-motored coupe much more than a revival of the el Camino. — _Daniel Pund, Senior Editor, Detroit_ "

Seriously would you want to drive an el Camino again?
