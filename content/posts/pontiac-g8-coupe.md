This is one kick ass car. And I think I actually like the Orange color. I also agree with the editors comments "**What this means to you:** We don't care if they call it GTO or Firebird or Powder Puff. We still want this Corvette-motored coupe much more than a revival of the el Camino. â€” _Daniel Pund, Senior Editor, Detroit_      " Seriously would you want to drive an el Camino again?
