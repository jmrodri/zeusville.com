So I've run through my car options a thousand times. I'm not quite sure what the best option is. I know which one I want, but what I want isn't always the best thing. .......

Options:

3.  buy a car and get rid of the Trans Am

6.  buy a car, and keep the Trans Am

9.  fix the Trans Am and live with it a bit longer.

I really wouldn't mind doing option 3. But since the car is 12 years old with 139,000 miles, I'm not sure if it's going down the path of fix one thing, then another breaks. I've inquired to see how much it would cost to rebuild the engine, I got an estimated $5,300. Removing and replacing engine is $1,500 of the $5,300. But it would be nice to get the car close to original condition. There really is so much potential for the car and plenty of aftermarket parts. I suspect option 3 is the money pit option.

Out of the other two options, I prefer option 2 where I could buy a car and keep the Trans Am. The rub comes with the fact that I can't really afford a new car right now, which means I'd have to settle for a used car. So here are the cars I wouldn't mind owning, though some more so than others.

    *   cons

        *   front-wheel drive with a V-8 probably has a lot of torque steer

        *   automatic only

        *   not a very hip car



Unfortunately, I think getting the GTO will be out of the question especially if I want to keep the Trans Am. In which case I think I like the two cop cars the best. They don't have manual transmissions available, but they can seat the entire family and they have V-8 power. But the reason I'm so torn is that the Mazda's are actually fun to drive and have much better fuel economy.

After writing this entry, I'm not sure I'm willing to do option 1. Trading the Trans Am in wouldn't garner me much money. So I guess I've really only got 2 options :)

Until next time.

It would really depend on your choice.. I guess there are lots of things that needs to be considered.. Car buying is really a process - you have to think it over and over again before making a decision. I can relate with your situation. Well I had this car for almost 10 years now - lots of parts had been replaced (like [toyota suspension bushing](http://www.autotoyparts.com/toyota-suspension-bushings/ "toyota suspension bushing"),fuel pump, radiator,etc) and I've been thinking of buying a newer car. The only problem I have is that my budget is not enough to buy one. \*sighs\* I think I had to save up first and use my car for the meantime and hope that there would be no problems. finger crossed

You have front-wheel drive as cons? I used to have rear-wheel drive cars, but now have second front-wheel car and it is much better to drive.

Dude, Just go out and buy a car. I wouldn't get one of the cop cars, but that's just me. If you go down that route.... http://www.cadillac.com/cadillacjsp/model/gallery.jsp?model=dts&year=2007 Fwiw, I like my little protege (predecessor to the mazda3) just fine.
