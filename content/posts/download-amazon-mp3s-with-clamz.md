While I applaud Amazon for providing an MP3 [downloader](http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/help/amd.html/ref=dm_amd_upgrade_img_1010) for Linux, but it is always several releases behind for Fedora. The current one available is Fedora 11, while the current [Fedora release is 14](http://www.fedora.redhat.com/get-fedora).

For a while there I kept an old Fedora release running in a guest just to download MP3 albums from Amazon, then I found [clamz](http://code.google.com/p/clamz/). It's a command line based amz file downloader. Simple point it to the .amz file and it'll do it's magic:

```
\[jmrodri@firebird Iron Maiden\]$ mkdir "Piece of Mind"

\[jmrodr@firebird Iron Maiden\]$ cd Piece\\ of\\ Mind/

\[jmrodri@firebird Piece of Mind\]$ clamz ~/Download/AmazonMP3-12345...amz

Downloading "01 - Where Eagles Dare.mp3"

Where Eagles Dare                 \[#################################\]  100%

Downloading "02 - Revelations (Album Version).mp3"

Revelations (Album Version)       \[#################################\]  100%

Downloading "03 - Flight Of Icarus (Album Version).mp3"

It's awesome! Checkout [clamz](http://code.google.com/p/clamz/) if you're a Amazon MP3 customer running on Linux.

I think it is worth noting that clamz is available in the fedora repos
