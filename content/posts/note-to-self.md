I want to run make test-srpm on all of the Makefiles in my tree. Worked great.

`find . -name Makefile | sed 's/Makefile//g' |Â  xargs -n 1 -I foo make -C foo test-srpm`

Once I learned sed and awk, combined them with find and xargs, I've gone crazy with the command line. Where once I used to write little Java programs, hrm is that even possible, little Java programs? I now use the command line.
