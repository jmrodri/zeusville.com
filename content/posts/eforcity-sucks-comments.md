Another thing you might care about -- who makes that card? That might affect whether or not you have decent drivers.

PCI 4-port internal for cheap is normally a Promise TX4. sata\_promise worked like a charm, no setup or fuss, on my Fedora 8 fileserver.

I chalk part (but only a small part) of the problem down to the fact that there just \*are not many\* 4-port internal cards. There's... Err, oneish, I think. You'd think they'd be far more common.

\[...\] 14 08 2008 I gave up dealing with Eforcity.com and ordered my SATA controller from Newegg.com, which is where I shouldâ€™ve gone in the first \[...\]

i had the exact same experience with eforcity. They SUCK. I ordered a screen protector for my laptop screen. I checked the dimensions carefully and ordered the normal 4:3 one. They sent me the widescreen one! For the next month I tried to get a refund or an exchange. They kept insisting they sent me the right one because they had stuffed the wrong sized one into an envelope for the right sized one. So based on the barcode of the envelope, they claimed it was the right one and that I should expect the protector to be 'slightly smaller' than the actual screen. Morons! This wasnt 'slightly smaller', it was the widescreen one!!!
