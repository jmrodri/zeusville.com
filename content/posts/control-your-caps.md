On all of my computers I use gnome-tweak-tool to remap CAPSLOCK to CTRL. But there are times when I'm working in a virtual machine that doesn't have that setup so I need to go back to old school methods. If you're on a box just run this from any terminal:```
setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps
```That avoids trying to kill a program with `C` which usually doesn't work :)
