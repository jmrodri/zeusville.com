\[...\] fixed (for now) 16 07 2010 As many of you know I’ve had quite a fun time getting my TiVo Premiere working with Time Warner Cable. The process started on June 15th when Time Warner came out \[...\]

Great story. I've had a TiVO with Time Warner for at least a year now, and it is annoying as hell how often they screw it up. Their last cable lineup change took 3-4 days before I could finally get the TiVO to work with it; multiple TiVO reboots, tuning adapter reboots, and it seems to be working. Glad to know you've joined the club, now we can both complain.... -Eric
