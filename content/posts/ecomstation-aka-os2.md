Many rumors have claimed that OS/2 is dead (just like many have claimed that Elvis is dead), but we all know that both are alive and well. OS/2 is (and has been) distributed by Serenity Systems under the name of [eComStation](http://www.ecomstation.com/), which is e-Commerce workStation. Serenity Systems has released the product [roadmap](http://www.ecomstation.com/edp/mod.php?mod=ecsfile&get=21)![](http://jroller.com/resources/jmrodri/acroread.png) for eComStation. And if anyone thinks, "but I bet there are no decent applications for eComStation". You're wrong again. Check out the following list. 1) [OpenOffice](http://www.ecomstation.com/openoffice.phtml?title=OpenOffice.org%201.1.1%20for%20eComStation%20Released) 2) [GCC for OS/2](http://www.innotek.de/products/gccos2/) 3) [Java](http://www.innotek.de/products/javaos2/javaos2general_e.html) 4) [Macromedia Flash](http://www.innotek.de/products/flash/flashnews_e.html) 5) [Acrobat Reader](http://www.innotek.de/products/acrobatos2/acrobatos2general_e.html) 6) [TrueType Font support](http://www.innotek.de/products/ft2lib/ft2libgeneral_e.html) 7) [Universal Audio Drivers](http://www.innotek.de/products/uniaud/general_e.html) 8) [Watcom C/C++ compiler](http://www.openwatcom.org/) If you're looking for an alternative to Windows, and Linux is too complex for you, give eComStation a try.
