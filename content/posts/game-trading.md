I bought [Avatar: The Last Airbender](http://www.amazon.com/THQ-752919520581-Avatar-Last-Airbender/dp/B000FII15I/sr=8-1/qid=1172679321/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-2319958-5828017?ie=UTF8&s=videogames) game for my [Xbox](http://www.microsoft.com/xbox/) but I am **NOT** impressed. It is a single player game which means my boys won't want to play it, and after 5 minutes into the game I was bored. Since I already opened it, I couldn't return it to Target. And the idea of selling it on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com) didn't appeal to me (eBay isn't as fun as it used to be).

I decided to find a game trading site, I am using [lala.com](http://www.lala.com/frontend/action/karma?userToken=15338@12708) to trade CDs, figured there has to be a site for trading games (or I would create one) :) Fortunately, and unfortunately for my hopes of getting rich, I found one called: [goozex.com](http://www.goozex.com).
