[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0rc1/releasenotes/#whatsnew) 3.0b5 has been way to unstable for me on [Fedora 9](http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora). It would simply hang every few minutes. I tried [Epiphany](http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/) and it's been flawless. I disabled all the plugins in Firefox, but it still did the same thing. Maybe I'll have time to debug further.
