[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0rc1/releasenotes/#whatsnew) 3.0b5 has been way to unstable for me on [Fedora 9](http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora). It would simply hang every few minutes. I tried [Epiphany](http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/) and it's been flawless. I disabled all the plugins in Firefox, but it still did the same thing. Maybe I'll have time to debug further.

Strange. I never had this problem...

Same for me. I wonder why such unstable software was introduced in Fedora? They should ship F9 with Firefox 2 instead.

Don't panic; this is just the known issue with sqlite being overenthusiastic with the use of fsync. A patched version is in the pipeline.

Hi, This is a known issue. See here: http://shaver.off.net/diary/2008/05/25/fsyncers-and-curveballs/ Should be "fixed" soon.

Probably the fsync issue. Here are some links to some blog posts regarding that: http://shaver.off.net/diary/2008/05/25/fsyncers-and-curveballs/ http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=368
