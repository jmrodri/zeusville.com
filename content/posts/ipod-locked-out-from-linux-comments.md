Looks like they've already reverse engineered it: http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Sep-16.html Fortunately I saw that after I wrote and sent my scathing feedback, not hesitating to throw in how much their iTunes content restrictions and closed source Mac OSX suck and keep me from using otherwise fantastic products.
