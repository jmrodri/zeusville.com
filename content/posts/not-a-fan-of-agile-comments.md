(A) Scrum is designed by consultants. (B) It's designed to make software more like blue collar factory work, but with the team micromanaging itself. Just like open office floorplans, they want to keep you working all the time. It also has this incredibly flawed concept that everyone is equal and everyone can do all the work. Different people can/should own different things based on ability and interest. (C) My issue is it is so focused on pace and microestimating it starves thinking and planning. It seems less agile than old XP ideas where you could just rethink what you were doing all the time. Especially when you yourself can't introduce new ideas without a lot of second guessing. (D) I see absolutely no benefits in the ability to schedule. I actually see less visibility. In many cases, it's fuzzier. (E) Many folks that like it haven't seen the old way (spec, engineering signoff, estimates, and reasonable deadline) work. Release slippage is not neccessarily evil either.

Hard to get right probably. If you feel your "special agile software" makes things harder, either you're expecting it to do the thinking for you, or it's just bad. Throw it away. Sometimes, more is less; a wiki, or text file can do as well; depending on the size of the team. I'm wondering why didn't you like the scrum meetings. For our project, we decided that we're too big for company-wide meetings to scale and I still miss them a lot. I mean, it greatly increased visibility into project, probably into areas which weren't interesting enough for me to look into otherwise. Also, unexpected and valuable input from colleagues into my problems was spared me some trials and errors rather often.
