Tonights zmugfs update is permissions and time are now shown correctly. I defaulted the user and group to that of the user running the program (in this case me) :) And I now show the date and time correctly from the api.

**Update**: by "in this case me" it doesn't mean I hardcoded my uid and gid. I used os.getuid() and os.getgid()

By the way, disregard the drew and foo entries. Those are debug strings which will be removed.
