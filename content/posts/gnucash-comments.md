Count me in gnucash' legion of fans (so to speak). While the interface could be better, the reporting sometimes makes it complicated, and it lacks an archival function (or at least I couldn't find one), I've been using it for the past year and a half, and I love it. But there absolutely is a learning curve. Once you understand the double-entry system it's really great.

Congrats on finding a new money program. I had been using MS Money for my windows machine and just recently switched to exclusively linux computing. I am now running a virtual box to boot into windows to do my MS Money stuff. Glad you were able to find something that worked for you. Maybe I will get GnuCash another look.

GnuCash rocks. And for my wife's business, we have been using sql-ledger. We will probably move to its fork, LedgerSMB. The advantage of LedgerSMB is that they are webapps designed for multi-user usage, etc. None of the financial apps are "pretty" but Gnucash isn't bad. :) -todd
