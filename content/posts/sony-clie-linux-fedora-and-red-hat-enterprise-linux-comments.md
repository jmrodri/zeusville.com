Nice writeup! I found your link because I was googling 'clie fedora'...Guess what my problem is... Everytime I try an other distro, I hit the same useability wall.. and go back to win for a few months, until things start to 'itch'. Then I download a new distro, try it out, and beng hit the wall again. Oh well. Perhaps Linux will get there sometime
