Sigh when I need to upload photos in a timely fashion, gthumb-import begins to misbehave.

**Update:** rebooting back to the old kernel get import working again: 2.6.24.3-12.fc8.

I've been getting a similar error to this. It usually happens after I've done one transfer and it goes back to see if there are any additional pictures on the device. I'll have to take a closer look next time.
