This is the kind of totally misinformed statement that I really wish Java devs would stop making. Java already has world-class developement tools like IDEA, JBuilder, Eclipse and JDeveloper which far, far surpass VisualStudio.NET in every way imaginable. Java IDEs can handle everything from editing HTML to deploying an enterprise app and have extremely powerful 'meta' features like refactoring and ant integration. VisualStudio.NET isn't much more than a Code/HTML/XML editor which, in itself, has tons of usability issues. As someone who used both java dev tools and VS.NET extensively I don't even think it's a fair comparison. VS.NET can't even begin to compete until you start shelling out more dough to buy plugins. The point of this little rant is simply to emphasize that you shouldn't buy into FUD and hype. Anybody in the know would quickly realize how silly it is to claim there's some sort of 'IDE Gap'.
