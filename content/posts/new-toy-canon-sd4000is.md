I got a new point and shoot digital camera. It's a Canon SD4000IS black. It replaces my _drowned_ Canon SD1100IS ELPH which never survived taking a swim in Puerto Rico.

Some of the features I like about the camera.

*   HD 720p movies

*   slow motion movies (albeit lowres)

*   small size

*   10 megapixel
