We spent the week in Myrtle Beach, SC. The boys loved the beach and started to brave the waves. Marco is fearless and tries to keep up with his older brother, Adan.

While on vacation we hit the beach a lot and ate a lot. Being from Maryland, we miss good seafood (hard to find here in North Carolina), so we hit Phillip's Seafood restaurant. Twice. The first night I got two Chesapeake Bay style crab cakes. They were awesome, but I still longed for more crab meat. The second time we went back I got a dozen steamed Blue Crabs. I only ate 10 of them. They were good and seasoned just right because my lips were burning afterwords.

Marco kept asking to go to the "animal zoo", but he didn't realize he was looking at a mini-golf with animals. We opted to go to Alligator Adventure so he could see real animals. The boys had a good time looking at alligators, snakes, frogs, turtles, and some exotic birds such as cockatoo, and macaws.

Ah the macaws, while looking at them I started doing my usual animal noises. "ma-CAW, ma-CAW". The birds responded with ma-CAW. Adan, looked in amazement and said "Daddy, I didn't know you could talk to animals. You're like Tarzan."

A great time was had by all.
