As Father Tighe said today "He is risen!" It was a wonderful service this morning and the day is turning out quite well. Happy Easter everyone.

It was a good weekend. Had the niece and nephew celebrate the usual fertility rites of spring via looking for zillions of easter eggs in our woods. Someday we will have to find the one missing plastic egg. Note for future egg hunts: don't ever use any artificial eggs. Lovely weekend. -todd
