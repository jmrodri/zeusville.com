Here it is Tuesday morning and it's snowing. Apparently some moisture from the Gulf has come up from the south giving us snow this morning. Looks heavy though the roads on the way in this morning (9am) seemed fine. But this isn't what the weather folks expected. They weren't expecting anything until the storm of the coast throws some moisture back towards the Triangle. I'll believe it when I see it.
