As many of you know I've had quite a [fun time](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2010/07/13/now-its-getting-personal/) getting my [TiVo](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2010/07/08/tivo/) Premiere working with [Time Warner Cable](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/time-warner-cable-on-bbb/). The process started on June 15th when Time Warner came out to install the CableCARD and tuning adapter but they brought a bad CableCARD. After MANY visits and calls, a tech came out on July 3rd with a working CableCARD. This lasted 1 week! When there was a storm and we lost power at the house briefly, enough to reboot everything. From that point on the tuning adapter wouldn't work. On [Tuesday July 13th](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2010/07/13/now-its-getting-personal/), they had a tech at my house for **THREE HOURS** only to determine that I had a bad tuning adapter :) This

when the shit hit the fan.

Wednesday evening my neighbor, who works for Time Warner as an installer, asked me why I had 2 trucks at my house. I explained to him and he was appalled at the incompetence. He asked for my account number and said he'd take care of things for me. Thursday morning I got a call from Bob @ Time Warner Cable, apparently one of the 'big guys' in the Raleigh office. He apologized profusely, said there was 'opportunity for improvement' and that he'd have a guy at my house TODAY with a tuning adapter instead of Saturday. After lunch my neighbor calls saying 'I've got a brand new tuning adapter for you. I'll install it when I get home'. Meanwhile, at 2pm I get a TWC truck roll up to the house. I ask him why he's here (since my neighbor has the job in his queue). The tech said, I was told to get up here ASAP because you need a tuning adapter. YAY! for communication. Either I get no service or I get superb service. I sent the tech away since I knew my neighbor would take care of things PROPERLY.

That evening my neighbor shows up with a nice new tuning adapter, we plug it in. Let it provision itself, test, reboot tuning adapter, retest and IT WORKS! Finally after a week we get a working tuning adapter.

So how long does it take to install a TiVo with Time Warner? Let's see it by the numbers:

*   one month

*   7 tech visits

*   9 truck rolls

*   2 CableCARDs

*   2 tuning adapters

*   4 consumer group complaints (NC DOJ, BBB, FCC, WRAL 5 on your side)

If you are planning on getting a [TiVo](http://www.tivo.com) which despite my experience is an AWESOME DVR! My advice to you is be patient and persistent.

Check back next week to see if I start the process again.

That was absurd. Nice to hear it's sorted anyhow.
