Keeping a blog interesting and up to date is extremely time consuming. I never realized how much time would be required to come up with interesting content daily. As you can see this is not one of my interesting pieces of content :)

It truly is a lot of work, Jesus. I don't think anyone will fault you, however, dfor having some other things on your mind with a new baby in your home! Babies are a lot of work, too - I have four of my own. Congratulations! Rick
