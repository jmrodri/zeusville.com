I only watch it when it has be Tivo'd. I dont like the stupid acting the guy and girl do to "steal" the cars. I also like the great biker build off, and Monter Garage. I have not seen the new episode of Motorcycle Mania. Kid Rock is supposed to be on with Jesse James. Maybe it is later this month yet...

I forgot one more thing. Instead of rebuilding the motor. Drop in a Banks twin turbo. Gene Banks was on an episode of Horsepower TV and his crate motors with twin turbos turn out 1,100 HP. The single turbos turn out 600HP.
