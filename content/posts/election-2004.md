I'm saddened by the fact that the people of the United States would be willing to re-elect President [Bush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W_Bush) for another term. But I can take pride in that I was not part of that majority, I voted for [John Kerry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F_Kerry) and [John Edwards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_edwards).

It will be interesting to see who the Democrats put up in 2008. I'm betting the following will give it a go for President: [Hillary Clinton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton), [Howard Dean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean), or [Borack Obama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama).

My predictions for the next four years with President Bush at the helm are as follows:

1\. We will be out of Iraq, but a new fundamentalist Islamic regime will take over  
2\. North Korea will have a strong Nuclear (or as Bush says it: New-cue-ler) program  
3\. Iran will be under tough sanctions and the threat of war will loom  
4\. The deficit will be at $1.2 trillion dollars  
5\. [Osama bin Laden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_laden) will still be making videos treatening the US  
6\. Abortion will continue to be legal, but more restrictions like parental notification for minors will occur.
