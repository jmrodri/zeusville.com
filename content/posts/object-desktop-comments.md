Thanks for remembering.... I wrote the OS/2 version! What did you like about it? Are you using the Windows version?

No I'm not using the Windows version. I use Windows at work only because I have to. I finally retired my OS/2 Warp installation lastyear and switched to Linux. I liked the window controls added to allow rollup, the object packaging was great. There are many other features of Object Desktop that I can't name them all.
