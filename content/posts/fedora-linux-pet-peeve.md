As much as I like Linux, there are still some things I find annoying. The default [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) menu is ugly and cluttered. I applaud the distribution coming with so many applications giving a user choice, but sometimes choice is a bad thing.

And why isn't there a Terminal icon in the [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) Panel?

IMHO, Debian is a much better choice than Fedora for ppl who are migrating from RH.
