Ha! I know what you mean . . . I actually have a lot of respect for her and appreciate the good things she does. Every now and then I like watching the tear-jerker stories where she buys deserving people new houses or reunites long-lost relatives. But a lot of times she comes off as really self-righteous and other times she just seems bored by her own guests.
