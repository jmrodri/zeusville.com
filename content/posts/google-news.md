Well, Google has released satellite maps on their [maps.google.com](http://maps.google.com) site. You can drag the map around (both the drawing and the satellite image). When getting driving directions the route is highlighted almost perfectly on the map.

Google continues to give me more space on my Google account. I'm upto 2062 MB about 2.014 GB.

Another bit of news is a former co-worker, Chip Turner, has left Red Hat to pursue a career at [Google](http://www.google.com). Though I'm sad to see him leave the [RHN](http://rhn.redhat.com) team, he'll be a great asset to Google. Good luck Chip!
