[![flying high](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png)](http://xkcd.com/353/)

A co-worker sent me today's [xkcd](http://xkcd.com). I loved it because it describes exactly how I felt when I learned [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29).

I learned it earlier this year and even released [my own project](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=205794) using Python. If you're bored with your [current programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_programming) as I was, give [Python](http://www.python.org) a try. Programming will become fun again.

You. Must. Learn. Erlang. That is all. :-)

Nice cartoon, but if I get bored with Java my temptation will be to either revisit C++ or do some more dabbling with Ruby or Erlang. And after that I think I'd put Lisp, Haskell, Scheme, Scala, Groovy, Nice, Ada, Perl, Forth, Dylan, D, Oberon, Modula-II, COBOL, Prolog, TCL, SNOBOL, FORTRAN, RPG IV, and Lua on my list just before Python. ;-)
