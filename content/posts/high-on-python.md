[![flying high](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png)](http://xkcd.com/353/) A co-worker sent me today's [xkcd](http://xkcd.com). I loved it because it describes exactly how I felt when I learned [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29). I learned it earlier this year and even released [my own project](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=205794) using Python. If you're bored with your [current programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_programming) as I was, give [Python](http://www.python.org) a try. Programming will become fun again.
