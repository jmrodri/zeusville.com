This past week, Liz & Adán had their version of the Navy's ["Hell Week"](http://science.howstuffworks.com/navy-seal7.htm). Liz stayed home the entire week to potty train Adán. There were several accidents and a few resistant moments, but on Friday, Adán went to the potty by himself (Liz wasn't far behind).

In addition to the potty training Liz was getting ready for a huge yard sale that was held yesterday, 8/21/2004.
