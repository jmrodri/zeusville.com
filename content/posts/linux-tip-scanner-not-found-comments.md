Did you have to reboot after doing chmod 666 /dev/sg0? I have the exact same scanner and the exact same problem. I have tried doing exactly what you did and when I run xsane as root I get it still can't find the scanner. But dmesg shows linux sees it? Oh and I agree with you, it should work right after you plug it in for everyone. If this is indeed a permissions issue, how stupid is that. Its just a scanner!!!!
