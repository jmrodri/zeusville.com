Not only was April 19th, 2007 my dad's 66th birthday, it was my 3rd anniversary with [Red Hat](http://rhn.redhat.com).

Congratulation Jesus. I hear that they make veterans like you into "Team Leads". ;-)

/me knows who he's harassing with his newbie questions tomorrow! Congrats on 3 years! Also in response to your recent response on me ol blog, how did your Mom make out with Ubuntu anyhow? I adore the Linux desktop experience and while I haven't used it it sounds like Microsoft has done us a huge favor by releasing a resource hogging overpriced operating system that threatens to turn anyone who uses it into a criminal. I've been trying to sway my folks for a couple years, not luck yet but maybe someday.
