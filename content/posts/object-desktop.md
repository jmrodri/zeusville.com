A few years ago there was an operating system called OS/2 Warp which to this day has the best user interface I've seen on any operating system, called the Workplace Shell. [Stardock Systems](http://www.stardock.com) had a wonderful extension to this shell called Object Desktop. Now you can get [Object Desktop](http://www.stardock.com/products/odnt/) for Windows to make the lame Windows gui usable.

[Desktop X](http://www.stardock.com/products/desktopx/) is another nice utility for making your Windows gui usable. And it can be downloaded for [free](http://www.stardock.com/products/desktopx/downloads.asp).
