A few years ago there was an operating system called OS/2 Warp which to this day has the best user interface I've seen on any operating system, called the Workplace Shell. [Stardock Systems](http://www.stardock.com) had a wonderful extension to this shell called Object Desktop. Now you can get [Object Desktop](http://www.stardock.com/products/odnt/) for Windows to make the lame Windows gui usable.

[Desktop X](http://www.stardock.com/products/desktopx/) is another nice utility for making your Windows gui usable. And it can be downloaded for [free](http://www.stardock.com/products/desktopx/downloads.asp).

Thanks for remembering.... I wrote the OS/2 version! What did you like about it? Are you using the Windows version?

No I'm not using the Windows version. I use Windows at work only because I have to. I finally retired my OS/2 Warp installation lastyear and switched to Linux. I liked the window controls added to allow rollup, the object packaging was great. There are many other features of Object Desktop that I can't name them all.
