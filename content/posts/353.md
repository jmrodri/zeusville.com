It's time to take the dive into [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). I just got two new books on [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). ["Agile Web Development with Rails"](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-Rails-Dave-Thomas/dp/0977616630/sr=8-1/qid=1169560305/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-0439918-2168659?ie=UTF8&s=books) and ["Programming Ruby"](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-Pragmatic-Programmers-Second/dp/0974514055/sr=1-1/qid=1169560405/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-0439918-2168659?ie=UTF8&s=books). It will be interesting to see how [ActiveRecord](http://rubyforge.org/projects/activerecord/) works compared to [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org), and the web pages as opposed to the [jsps](http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/) and [Struts](http://struts.apache.org/). I'm probably getting my hopes up that it will be dramatically simpler than doing a web app in Java, which as we all know, has become a pain in the butt.
