Adán's bedtime routine has gotten a lot easier. Last night he actually ended the bath instead of me saying "It's time to go now". He said, "Daddy, all done bath".

He has memorized the books we read at night. Not sure if this is a good thing but it sure makes it easier on me since he **reads** to me.

Here's the list of books we read:

\- [The Foot Book : Dr. Seuss's Wacky Book of Opposites](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679882804/qid=1091024834/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/102-5677022-8786551?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)
\- [Go, Dog. Go! (Bright & Early Board Books)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067988629X/qid=1091024878/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-5677022-8786551)
\- [Goodnight Moon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0694003611/qid=1091024915/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-5677022-8786551)
\- [The Cat in the hat Flips his Lid](http://www.funtocollect.com/catsoundbook.html)

Then he sings the following songs:

\- Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star
\- ABC song
\- Row Row You Boat
\- Itsy Spider
\- Old Macdonald from the singing bridge in a Dora the Explorer episode.

Then a little water, and the blankets must be JUST right or he'll get up and knock on the door. But that's it.
