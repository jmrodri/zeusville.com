[Stop the Cap!](http://stopthecap.com/) ran a story regarding the proposed [DOCSIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCSIS) [3.1 standard.](http://stopthecap.com/2013/06/12/cable-industry-readies-docsis-3-1-up-to-101gbps-if-they-decide-you-need-it/) While many of the cable companies offer 50Mb+.

Comcast has 105Mb for $90/month,

Verizon has FiOS rated at 150Mb even 300Mb. They're 75Mb/35Mb option is $70/month.

Cox Communications even has 100Mb for $100.

Time Warner Cable is always the hold out. They offer 50Mb / 5Mb for $75. While the other companies are offering something about $1/Mb Time Warner Cable is at $1.50 / Mb. And the upload speed of 5Mb is abysmal especially compared with Verizon's FiOS.

And Time Warner's CTO clearly doesn't think we want fast internet.

I suspect not many people are subscribing to the 50/5 offering so clearly their data would show little demand. But I think the problem is the price. 50/5 for $49.99 would be totally worth it. But for $75 that's just outrageous. It would be great to have more competition here in NC, but with Time Warner Cable [lobbying against competition](http://www.ilsr.org/killing-competition-nc/), that will likely never happen.
