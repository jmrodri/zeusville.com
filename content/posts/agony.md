Right now my team, the Maryland Terrapins, are choking against the Miami Hurricanes in the ACC tournament.  It's 37-24 Miami. I knew a 6 game winning streak by Maryland was a bad thing going into the tournaments :(  I hope they can put it together after halftime, but I've been disappointed many times in the past during tourney time.
