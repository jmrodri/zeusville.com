I think on one of my systems (forget which, I think the "home" development setup but might have been the work one -- I think that monitor had a weirder aspect ratio), I ended up setting up xrandr to run on GNOME startup as an custom trigger/script, for similar reasons. Can't remember if I got it fixed correctly or not :)

I have similar config except this line: Modes "1600x1200" inside Subsection "Display" After reboot system-config-display picks up new resolution.

The modeline and preferredmode lines are supposed to go in the Monitor section, not the Screen section. http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12 is pretty much the bible for all things RandR 1.2 :)
