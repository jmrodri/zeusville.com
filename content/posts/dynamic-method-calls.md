As you may know I'm working on updating [sm-photo-tool](http://sm-photo-tool.sourceforge.net/)
from [XMLPRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLRPC) to [REST.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)
I wanted similar functionality with the [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)
implementation as with [XMLRPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLRPC). That is I
wanted to be able to do things like this:

```python
sm = Smugmug()
sm.login.withPassword("foo@foo.com", "password")
```

I couldn't find a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) library I liked
probably because it's trivial as all you need is a properly formatted url. I
knew it was possible to do the above with [XMLRPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLRPC)
in python:

```python
sm = ServerProxy("url")
sm.login.withPassword(...)
```

I looked through the xmlrpclib.py and stole the \_Method implementation from
it (with a slight modification):

```
class _Method:
   # some magic to bind an XML-RPC method to an RPC server.
   # supports "nested" methods (e.g. examples.getStateName)
   def __init__(self, send, name):
      self.__send = send
      self.__name = name

   def __getattr__(self, name):
      return _Method(self.__send, "%s.%s" % (self.__name, name))

   def __call__(self, **args):
      print "__name: %s" % self.__name
      print "args: " + str(args)
      return self.__send(self.__name, args)
```

Now I can make calls to [Smugmug's](http://www.smugmug.com%3Cbr%3E%3C/a%3E)
[REST api](http://smugmug.jot.com/WikiHome/REST).

```python
sm = Smugmug()
sm.smugmug.login.withPassword(EmailAddress="foo@foo.com", Password="foo")
```

Next stop is to get the parsing of the XML response.
