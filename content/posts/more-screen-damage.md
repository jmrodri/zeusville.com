Last [August](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/lg-env-touch-screen-problem/) I noticed some screen oddities and now I've got some damage to the right side of the screen. I took it to the local Verizon Wireless store and they said it was water damage. I'm not sure how but whatever, I'm getting a new one sent to me on Thursday.
