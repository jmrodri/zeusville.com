I'm not very good at writing shell scripts, mainly because of my ignorance to the power of the shell. Today I learned you can write a pretty complex shell script as an ssh command. For example, `ssh $REMOTE_USER$h /bin/bash << EOF [ -d $Build ] || { echo "ERROR: Build environment $Build missing" >&2 exit -1 } ... EOF` I found that cool.
