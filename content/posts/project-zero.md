I stumbled on IBM's [Project Zero](http://www.projectzero.org/wiki/bin/view/) today. It actually looks promising for folks that want to write simple Java web applications. Yes, simple and Java in the same sentence is usually an oxymoron. Project Zero uses a layout similar to [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/).Â  Project Zero allows for 2 scripting languages: [PHP](http://www.php.net/) and [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/). I've never really liked [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) because it seemed like a half-baked idea, but in the context of Project Zero, it seems rather useful.
