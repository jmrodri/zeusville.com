At the risk of getting flamed for going beyond the command line - I can thoroughly recommend webmin (http://www.webmin.com) - it's interface for sendmail configuration is really quite good.

No one should ever get flamed for not using the command line. I'd be perfectly happy if every admin task was available through a UI in Linux. And I think it would make it even more popular for the home user.
