I released a new version of [sm-photo-tool](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=179298&package_id=207078). It's a simple script that that was originally written by [John Ruttenberg](http://rutt.smugmug.com/) wrote. I took it and packaged it in rpm form and have been maintaining it under source control (versus a forum).

```
