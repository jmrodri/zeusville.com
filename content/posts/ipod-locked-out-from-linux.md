Apple locked out Linux users with their latest iPod firmware. I immediately wrote them a "Bug Report".

For more information read this article:

Then email Apple here: [http://www.apple.com/feedback/ipod.html](http://www.apple.com/feedback/ipod.html)

After you send out your email, go out and buy an [iAudio X5](http://www.cowonglobal.com/product/product_X5_feature.php) or an [iAudio 7](http://http://www.cowonglobal.com/product/product_i7_feature.php)
