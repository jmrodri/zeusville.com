If anyone is interested, I've built [Nvu](http://www.nvu.com/) for Fedora Core 1. Download it here: [nvu-0.20-pc-fedora1.tar.gz](http://zeusville.homeip.net/nvu-0.20-pc-fedora1.tar.gz). For other versions, go to [main download site](http://www.nvu.com/download.html).

THANK YOU, THANK YOU! I have been strugling to get Nvu to work on my newly set-up Linux (I am a non-geek female and new to Linux). I downloaded your tarball and I got to open the thing. Can't wait to try it out. Thank you so much again! Brynhildur

Thanx, I was using Mandrake Linux, but it just wasn't working. I saw that there was a fedor package available, so I downloaded Fedora Core 1. It would have all been a waste if you hadn't made this package for me. Thank you! :)
