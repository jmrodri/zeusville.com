> McMINNVILLE, Ore. - Two middle school boys facing sex abuse charges in connection with "spanking" incidents at Patton Middle School in McMinnville are back home with their parents after appearing in court on Tuesday.The two boys, ages 12 and 13, face the equivalent of felony sex abuse charges. In court, Yamhill County authorities said their investigation showed the boys slapped female classmates on their buttocks numerous times over the past several weeks, and poked their breasts.

> According to authorities, the boys were sometimes acting out a character known as 'Party Boy' from a movie based on a popular MTV television series.
> 
> Two of the victims testified in court they did not feel threatened and did not want the boys punished.
> 
> The judge ruled that the boys could go home pending trial, and also ordered 24-hour supervision and no contact with other kids tied to the investigation.
> 
> Meanwhile, the parents of the boys are still raising concerns about how the situation has unfolded.

In my opinion, this is utter crap. The girl victims stated they were not threatened, "Two of the victims testified in court they did not feel threatened and did not want the boys punished". I can't believe they had the boys (12 & 13) handcuffed at the waste.

There are much more serious crimes occurring in this country and we're going after 13 year olds.

I'm not advocating the behavior, I just think the punishment is way too extreme.
