Breaking news from some local news in Raleigh, North Carolina. "Winter storm warning in effect until 4am. We're expecting 2 - 5 inches of snow."

Well, Mr. Weatherman, where's the SNOW!!!! We got a dusting in Wake Forest.

The eastern shore is supposed to get the snow up here tonight...the weatherman has also said that depends on the track of the storm. If the storm moves further west we will get the snow...
