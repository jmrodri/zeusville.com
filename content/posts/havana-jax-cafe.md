Here in North Carolina there is an abundance of Mexican restaurants. Being Puerto Rican, I've always longed for Caribbean cuisine. About a month ago, Havana Jax Cafe, a Cuban restaurant opened up here in Wake Forest, NC. The food is great and the prices are reasonable.

If you're in the area stop by

Havana Jax Cafe
109-10 Capcom Avenue
Wake Forest, NC 27587

Stay tuned for a website.

There used to be a Cuban restaurant just off Franklin St in Chapel Hill. It's a bit hard to find, but it was in BankOfAmerica plaza I think.
