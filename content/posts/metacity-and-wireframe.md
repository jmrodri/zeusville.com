On my lowly PIII 650Mhz with 512MB ram and an Nvidia GeForce2 MX with 32MB, Metacity and GNOME run slow. Especially when moving windows around, metacity insisted that fullframe window movement was needed. Well, I decided to look on the net again to see if this has changed. And I found the solution [right here](http://wiki.chad.org/wiki.pl?MetacityWireframeDiscussion).
