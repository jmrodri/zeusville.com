Some how I got my CloudForms SystemEngine into a weird state. I unregistered a consumer while simultaneously removing it from the Katello UI. This caused a race condition because the UI got a 410 GONE error from Candlepin and it didn't remove it from its database. Clearly a bug but still that left me in a state where the Systems page would show the 410 ERROR and leave me with a spinning cursor. [![](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/410error.png "410error")](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/410error.png) [![](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/spinningcursor.png "spinningcursor")](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/spinningcursor.png) As this was simply a test setup I could've just reinstalled. But I wanted to know how this works. As you know Katello is made of many parts: [Pulp](http://pulpproject.org/), [Candlepin](http://candlepinproject.org/), and [Foreman](http://theforeman.org/). ![](http://katello.org/images/arch-diagram.png "katello diagram") My particular installation didn't have Foreman, so that left: Pulp, Candlepin, Katello proper, and Elasticsearch. Since we were getting a 410 from Candlepin that means the consumer was already gone from that database```
cp\_consumer
```table. First, I removed the system from Katello's database.```
\# psql -U katellouser katelloschema
katelloschema=> delete from systems where id = 1;
katelloschema=> commit;
katelloschema=> \\q

```Then I removed the consumer from Pulp:```
\# mongo
MongoDB shell version: 1.8.2
connecting to: test
> show dbs
admin	(empty)
local	(empty)
pulp\_database	0.203125GB
> use pulp\_database
switched to db pulp\_database
> show collections
...
consumers
...
> db.consumers.remove()
> 

```What in the world did you just do? :) We can see that pulp uses the```
pulp\_database
```. And that one of the collections was```
consumers
```. Running```
db.consumers.help()
```revealed there was a remove method. In my case I only had one system so I just did```
db.consumers.remove()
```. But if you have more you'll want to specify the key:```
db.consumers.remove({"\_id":"62d61426-3cf9-4afb-bc3b-e0f696950adc"})
```. Ok we're done. Let's go checkout Katello again. **UGH** Still shows spinning cursor. So what else could be pointing to the fact that we had a system? Elasticsearch which is the search engine for Katello. That just needs reindexing.```
\# cd /usr/share/katello
# rake reindex
Search Indices cleared.
Re-indexing ActivationKey
Re-indexing Changeset
Re-indexing Filter
Re-indexing GpgKey

# 

```Ok let's try one more time. Visit your systems page in Katello and now you should see that there is no longer a spinning cursor, but a blank list of systems. This is what I expected. **YAY!** [![](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/cleared.png "cleared")](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/cleared.png)
