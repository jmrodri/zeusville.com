Last night we needed to print photos for our son's project. We currently have a color laser which is great for printing lots of text documents with some graphics, but the [Xerox Phaser 6130n](http://www.office.xerox.com/printers/color-printers/phaser-6130/enus.html) is NOT a photo printer. I'm looking for a printer that can print decent photos nothing perfect, if I want better photos I can order them online from a photo place on real photo paper. But I have a laundry list of requirements. Requirements:

*   Must work with Linux specifically [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora)
*   Must work with [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)
*   Network capable (prefer hardwired no need for wireless)
*   Prefer ink tanks over cartridges, like my Canon S750.
*   Must have separate tanks for colors

Here's an example of the Canon ink tank. It's pretty cheap and doesn't need a new print head. This was great but the Canon S750 I have has very little driver support for either Linux or Mac and doesn't print very well anymore. ![ink tank](http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/public/4wy4giFrkyoKOYBFLvPad35erJGhNHzRD7IsX0pRlUWgsbu278ckkM4AbiMX-mu2ddPjGLpMoDYfW0Xj8tBBLEEJMAto-VC_ZY4Wg2zIjFbETsJ3voLiPtDZbZRNFKoKarOhJLDr1lHkpd3uQrW2RsJdmrH_IDFfOl6_JnLEIb2fV_nH-3YmxvYAtUrSDfnSY-nBrEgdMeDg4FiJIzc5sjck7d1f5IySq73pDA1dEsFyylJghY5nH3s0Qoi2PFYmOgEFh6-kwzonnKTdGP1soIdShZpE4UeP6fW_rwX7G2b9JEbd--JZbHsw4CsJv6f07n99pJRKzBUMXbuQC4MkcwJNqoZvZt8OpypofoRjtnSfX1mHuH3sCzk) Leave your recommendations in the comment area, thanks.
