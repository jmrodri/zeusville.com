I'm perpetually applying new themes to my desktop. Here are some of the sites I visit on a daily basis

looking for icons, [GTK2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtk) themes, and [Metacity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacity) themes:

[art.gnome](http://art.gnome.org), [gnome-look.org](http://www.gnome-look.org),

and, on occasion, [customize.org](http://www.customize.org).
