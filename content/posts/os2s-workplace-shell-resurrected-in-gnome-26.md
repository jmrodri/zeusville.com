After reading Sayamindu Dasgupta article [Diving Into GNOME 2.5 - A Preview of GNOME 2.6](http://www.clai.net/sayamindu/GNOME-2.6/GNOME_2_6.html), I noticed many of the features of Nautilus in GNOME 2.6 are a lot like the Workplace Shell (WPS) in OS/2 Warp or [eComStation](http://www.ecomstation.com). [![](http://jroller.com/resources/jmrodri/ecs2.png)](http://www.ecomstation.com/gallery/gal/eComStation_1.0/sample_desktop_screenshots/ecs2.jpg) The object-oriented nature is what made the Workplace Shell so powerful and the one reason I kept my OS/2 Warp 4 running for almost 8 years (I retired it back in early 2003 for [Red Hat Linux](http://www.redhat.com)). This is feature I've been waiting for. I've always missed the ease of use of the WPS.

I can't wait for [Fedora](http://fedora.redhat.com) [Core 2](http://fedora.redhat.com/participate/schedule/) with Kernel 2.6 & GNOME 2.6.
