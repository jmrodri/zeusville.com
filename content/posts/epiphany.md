Tonight while putting Adan to bed, he was stating some math fact: "0+0=0, 1+1=2, 2+2=4, 3+3=6, ...Daddy, guess what? I just noticed something, they're all even numbers!" I replied, "that's very good. You're right, any time you take to numbers and add them together you get an even number." I could see the light bulb over his head. I was proud.
