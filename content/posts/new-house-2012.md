Many of you know but some don't, this year (2012) we embarked on a wonderful adventure and, with God's grace, had the opportunity to build a new house. The adventure began one Sunday afternoon in February, our anniversary to be exact. We met withÂ [Andrew Pinter](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-pinter/17/308/717 "Andrew Pinter's LinkedIn Profile") of [Pinter Construction](http://www.pinterconstruction.com/ "Pinter Construction") to look at a .60 acre wooded lot. The neighborhood had stagnated because of the economic downturn with many of the old builders out of business. But we saw promise in the subdivision especially the location which put us just 5 miles from our old house which means commutes, schools, and routines wouldn't have to change much. While I was hesitant to make any decisions that day (pretty typical of me), Liz just **KNEW** this was the place. So we put a deposit on the lot that day.

We spent the next few weeks pouring over plan after plan. Ultimately we decided to modify one of Andrew's plans to suit our needs. The original house had your typical gable roof and not much character (in our opinion). We made most of the changes to the front elevation and the kitchen. Finally, on April 13th we signed the contract to start construction of our new home.

Mid April we walked the lot to select which trees we wanted to keep, I wanted to keep them all but that wasn't realistic and ultimately we did need a yard for the family. One of my favorite are the 2 oak trees that ultimately flanked the front of house. In the next two pictures I'm standing in the middle of the lot. The first picture is looking from the back to the front of the house at the 2 oak trees. The second picture are the trees we left (seen with orange tape) plus the wooded lot that behind us.

After they cleared the lot, next steps were to dig the foundation footers. They dug and poured the footers, then the truck that delivered the foundation materials had "JESUS CHRIST is LORD" on the side which was somewhat apropos. It was exciting to see the process progress.

The framing began in late May, and they had it pretty much done by the first week of June. The goal was to get the roof on and the house dried in. It's amazing how fast framing crews can frame a house.I think this was one of the fun stages as you see the house start to come together.

By June 30th, they made a lot of progress with the framing. Here the house has the siding, shakes, board and batten, shingles, and gable details. The stone, columns and metal roof come much later.

Then one warm Tuesday night in July, I played contractor myself and installed the speaker wires for the rear channel speakers and a pair in the screened in porch for some summer tunes. Most builders don't like you doing stuff, but Andrew didn't mind one bit, he actually helped me get started. I also ran CAT6 and CATV to the attic for future expansion. Check out the finished speaker installation below.

As work continues inside, the outside gets stone. But it is no less fun to walk through the house checking the progress.

Liz and her CBS friends came to the house one hot July night to write scripture on the floors, studs, and walls.

By mid August, the house has been painted, columns put up, stone installed and rough grading done. Inside the plumbing, electrical, cabinets, drywall, and more were all done. While it looks done, there is still quite a few months more of work left. At this point we still had to pick out tile, stain color, and confirm interior paint colors.

One evening in August, Marco found one of our many visitors. Here he holds one of the frogs that were hopping around the backyard during the summer.

Then on November 4th, we moved in to our new home!
