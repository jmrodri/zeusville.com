In case [Vonage](http://www.vonage.com) bites the bullet because [Verizon](http://www.verizon.com) can't compete outside the [courts](http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/23/HNvonageinjunction_1.html?source=rss&url=www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/23/HNvonageinjunction_1.html), I started looking for another possible VOIP provider. I really don't want to go back to my [old telco](http://www.embarq.com).

Here's a list of VOIP providers I've found:

*   [lingo](http://www.lingo.com/voip/residential/home_plans.jsp)

*   [SunRocket](https://www.sunrocket.com/)

*   [BroadVoice](http://www.broadvoice.com/)

*   [AT&T CallVantage](http://www.usa.att.com/callvantage/index.jsp?soac=76993)

*   [TimeWarnerCable Digital Phone](http://www.timewarnercable.com/nc/products/digitalphone/default.html)

For more information look through [whichvoip.com](http://www.whichvoip.com/)

I surely hope that Vonage will survive this injunction, as I've been a happy customer for over 2 years.

\[...\] With the all the trouble that Vonage has found itself in lately, many of its loyal subscribers have ... None have actually jumped ship as of yet. Most of them are just keeping their options open uncase the Vonage ship goes down under the weight of the court cases that seem to plague it. \[...\]

I hear rumors that SunRocket is having financial trouble right now, and may go bankrupt. So you may have to scratch one of those possibilities off your list eventually.
