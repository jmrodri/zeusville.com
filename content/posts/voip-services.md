In case [Vonage](http://www.vonage.com) bites the bullet because [Verizon](http://www.verizon.com) can't compete outside the [courts](http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/23/HNvonageinjunction_1.html?source=rss&url=www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/23/HNvonageinjunction_1.html), I started looking for another possible VOIP provider. I really don't want to go back to my [old telco](http://www.embarq.com). Here's a list of VOIP providers I've found:

*   [lingo](http://www.lingo.com/voip/residential/home_plans.jsp)
*   [SunRocket](https://www.sunrocket.com/)
*   [BroadVoice](http://www.broadvoice.com/)
*   [AT&T CallVantage](http://www.usa.att.com/callvantage/index.jsp?soac=76993)
*   [TimeWarnerCable Digital Phone](http://www.timewarnercable.com/nc/products/digitalphone/default.html)

For more information look through [whichvoip.com](http://www.whichvoip.com/) I surely hope that Vonage will survive this injunction, as I've been a happy customer for over 2 years.
