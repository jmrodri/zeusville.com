Nifty way to test out a github pull request:

```


git checkout master

# Check out your master branch

curl https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pull/25.patch | git am

# Grab the patch generated by a pull request and feed it into a new commit

Nice, as it also prevents asking people to resubmit their commits squashed!
