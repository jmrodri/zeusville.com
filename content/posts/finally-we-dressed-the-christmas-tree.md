Feeling the pressure of Christmas coming up fast, we finally got our Christmas tree today and decorated this evening. We also realized that with toddlers nice glass ornaments must be replaced by sturdier dough type ornaments. Turns out better this way since the kids can decorate as they please. It was an awesome sight.
