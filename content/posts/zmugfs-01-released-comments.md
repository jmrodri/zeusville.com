Hi, thanks for writing this! This was an itch I had for a long time, I am glad someone actually went ahead and wrote some code :-) I will definitely test the code (on Xubuntu & perhaps Debian 4.0) & hopefully I'll be able to pitch in as well at some point.

Hey - I created .debs using Alien. They install and run fine using Ubuntu 8.04, but I had to install python-simplejson also to make it work. E-mail if you want debs to post.
