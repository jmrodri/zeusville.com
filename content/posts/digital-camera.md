It's time for a digital camera. My Sony Clié TJ-27 has 310,000 pixel camera which pretty much sucks, except for maybe insurance pictures. But having this little camera has given me the digital camera bug.

I'm a brand loyalist, one of the few left I think, so I favor the [Sony DSC-P150](http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=DSCP150&Dept=dcc_DIDigitalCameras&CategoryName=dcc_DIDigitalCameras_Cyber-shotDigitalCameras#specs). I've already got memory sticks for my Clieé and would like to reuse these for my digital photos. The only camera I know of that use memory sticks are the Sony's. But most of my friends went with the Canon cameras. A former manager of mine, has a Canon G5, and Eric just got the new [Canon G6](http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelTechSpecsAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=10463).

Does anyone have any pro's and con's to which digital camera is better? Any bad experiences with either?
