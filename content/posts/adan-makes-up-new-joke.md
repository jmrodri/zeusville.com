Yesterday while visiting Abuelo y Abuela, Adán made up his first knock-knock by himself. It goes like this:

Knock Knock  
Who's there?  
Hair  
Hair who?  
Haircut!

This was very interesting to us since he just finished getting a haircut. And we see he understands patterns at the meer age of 2.5. Liz & I are so amazed.
