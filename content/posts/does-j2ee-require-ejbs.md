I've stated before that our project needs to move towards J2EE technology. And sometimes I'm "corrected" that I mean J2SE since our project isn't going to use EJBs. Since when does a J2EE application _**require**_ EJBs? Can't a web application be a J2EE application by mearly having JSPs, Servlets, and following the MVC architecture?
