I found [this little bit of satire](http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2007/asshole-driven-development/) about [software development models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology_(software_engineering)#Examples) today, it is quite funny (at least for those in the software industry). My two favorite from the post are:

> **Development By Denial** (DBD) - Everybody pretends there is a method for what’s being done, and that things are going ok, when in reality, things are a mess and the process is on the floor. The worse things get, the more people depend on their denial of what’s really happening, or their isolation in their own small part of the project, to survive.

and

> **Asshole Driven development** (ADD) - Any team where the biggest jerk makes all the big decisions is asshole driven development. All wisdom, logic or process goes out the window when Mr. Asshole is in the room, doing whatever idiotic, selfish thing he thinks is best. There may rules and processes, but Mr. A breaks them and people follow anyway.
