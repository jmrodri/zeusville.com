NC is looking to enact a voter id bill to help "protect" against voting fraud, primarily pushed for by conservatives because clearly that is why they must be losing elections. But what I find funny is that in NC, conservatives have one many of the seats that were up for re-election including the governorship. I think this bill will ultimately bite them in the butt when the tides shift. Here are some "voter fraud" links: [How widespread is voter fraud?](http://www.truethevote.org/news/how-widespread-is-voter-fraud-2012-facts-figures) [Inaccurate, Costly, and Inefficient...](http://www.pewtrusts.org/our_work_report_detail.aspx?id=85899370677) [How Much Voter Fraud Is There?](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2012/09/voter_id_laws_a_state_by_state_map_reveals_how_much_voter_fraud_there_is_in_the_united_states_almost_none_.html) [North Carolina On Cusp Of Passing Worst Voter Suppression Bill In The Nation](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/07/23/2340941/nc-voter-suppression/?mobile=nc) [North Carolina Voter ID Opponents React To Bill's Passage, Vow To Continue To Fight](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/north-carolina-voter-id_n_3156191.html) While I have a valid government issue ID and am ok with showing it to vote, my biggest problem with the bill is that I don't believe there is widespread voter fraud as this bill claims to solve. Personally I don't see the need for this bill.
