So I've been playing with [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) lately while reading[Agile Web Development with Rails](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-Rails-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0977616630/sr=8-1/qid=1171338428/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-2319958-5828017?ie=UTF8&s=books). While [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) can take some getting used to, especially for a java guy. It can be quite nice. I've been playing with other languages since falling off the java train, notably [python](http://www.python.org/) and I tabled in that line-noise of programming languages known as [perl](http://www.perl.org).

I haven't gone deep with any of the languages, except java. So I won't comment yet about ruby vs the others. What I will talk about is how cool Rails is compared to java + [JSF](http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/) or [Struts](http://struts.apache.org) or [SEAM](http://www.jboss.com/products/seam) or framework of choice. The problem with all the java frameworks is the amount of configuration you need to get anything done. For example, [struts-config.xml](http://struts.apache.org/1.x/userGuide/configuration.html), or checkout the SEAM [tutorial](http://docs.jboss.com/seam/1.0.1.GA/reference/en/html/tutorial.html) not one but four! xml files. This is where Rails excels, I don't have to edit an xml file or any file to connect my presentation to my controller. Rails uses "convention" versus "configuration". Struts could easily have used "convention". I mean if I created a path for my jsp that matched my action, Struts could easily have connected them. But I am forced to define the url in the struts-config.xml just to hook up the action and presentation. While I'm not saying Rails is the be all end all solution, I firmly believe that we should use the right tool for the job, the java world could learn a lot from the simplicity of Rails.

Rails is so nice. So is Python :-)
