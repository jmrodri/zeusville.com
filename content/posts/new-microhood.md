After almost a month, I finally decided to install the microhood today.  
  
I started by turning off the breaker, then removing the 6 screws from the old range hood. I had to drill two 3/8" holes in the cabinet and a 1.5" hole for the plug. Thankfully I didn't have to mess with the existing duct work. I did have to tape up the old wiring and push it into the wall, since the new microhood has a plug.  
  
The bracket had 4 springed wing bolts and 3 lag screws into the studs. To find centerline I crated my own plumb with a thread, push ping and a bolt. :)  
  
Liz helped me hook the microhood onto the bracket and get it screwed in from the top. Once it was in place, I plugged it in and switched the breaker. Thankfully no sparks :D  
  
Next text was turn on the light, followed by the fan. All worked. Last test was try out the actual microwave part. WOO HOO! nothing blew up.
