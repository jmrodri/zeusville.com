You would be totally amazed by what runs in wine these days. If I try $RANDOM\_WINDOWS\_APPS I have about an 80% success rate of them working in wine. Maybe try some of the apps your father-in-law runs in wine to see if they work well enough for him? We need more converts! :)

Hint: There is an awesome application similar to iTunes that does work in Linux. If you send me you e-mail to kristjan.siimson@gmail.com, I'll send you an invite back. Why? If you join, I get 50 free songs (if I remember correctly, then so will you).
