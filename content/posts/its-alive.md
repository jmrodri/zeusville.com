[![](http://www.carolinaautomasters.com/img/header.jpg)](http://www.carolinaautomasters.com/) After 2.5 weeks, I finally got my car back from the shop. The following things were fixed:

*   overheating
    *   flushed coolant
    *   fan relay
    *   reprogrammed computer to turn on fans earlier to compensate for a 40 degree delta between the temp gauge sensor and the water pump sensor
*   rough idle
    *   "fixed" the cat
*   maintenance
    *   changed rear diff fluid (it was overdue)
*   wouldn't start
    *   new starter
    *   new [Optima](http://www.optimabatteries.com/optima_edge/) battery (kick ass battery to replace my 6 year old Diehard)

A special thanks to [Carolina Auto Masters](http://www.carolinaautomasters.com/) for great work as usual.
