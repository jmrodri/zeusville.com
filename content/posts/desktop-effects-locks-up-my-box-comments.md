You should show this to Ajax, I bet he would know what's going on.

I am having the exact same problem and so far I have been unsuccessful in finding a solution. I have found that I can SSH into the box and when I issue a TOP command nothing seems abnormal Are you using NetworkManager? I have found that if I repeatedly attempt to connect to various networks I can force the X session to hang. I am unable to issue any commands (mouse still moves though) and I must resort to rebooting the system via the power button. I have a Dell 600m with an x300 card. Have you found a solution?

Well - I did some more searching online and found a message board describing this problem - one of the suggestions was to add a kernel boot up parameter in grub.conf file of "acpi=off". This seems to have worked for me as I have 48 hours uptime since and things are working normally again. Here is a link to the site: http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/printthread.php?t=139648&pp=80 ACPI is some spec for handling the information a BIOS uses for configuration and power interface(power management). I'm guessing that this is what KDE/X or my graphics card is having trouble with when it freezes/locks/hangs/etc. Hope this helps others out there.

Is there any update on this? When I first installed FC6 I had this issue - I can't remember what I did to fix it - I've had my machine working normally for a year now and all of a sudden the box locks up or reboots randomly within the first 5-45 mins of use no matter what I try. When the box locks up I can not ssh into it from elsewhere - it's completely frozen. I'm not using 64bit, beryl/compiz or any desktop effects that I know of. I start kde and I think I have to be using at least firefox or another program for this to happen. I have stuff in ~/.xsession-errors but it's DCOP notifications and then X Error: BadMatch, BadPixmap and BadWindow errors that are foreign to me. If anyone has solved this please post! Thanks, Matt.
