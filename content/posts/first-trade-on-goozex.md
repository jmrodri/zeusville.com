I made my first trade on [goozex.com](http://www.goozex.com). Got rid of my Avatar game which gets me 500 goozex points. Trading is a lot easier than trying to sell games on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com) or [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com)

I liked at goozex, seems like a nicely designed gaming site. Since I also trade movies, I use http:///www.playinterchange.com plus their fees gets donated to charities which is always a good thing!

The best part of goozex.com is that each game is assigned a point value. So it removes the whole negotiation factor out of trading, and makes the games trade faster because the need to reach an agreement is removed entirely.
