JDBInsight (now a sub component of JXInsight) has been in production at some very large J2EE sites for the last 3 years. Honestl there was simply no need for another logging driver especially as most implementations are extremely primitive only performing System.out calls. You and Ryan should check out the following links to see the tooling that is required for enterprise production systems in both test and production modes. http://www.jinspired.com/products/jxinsight/new-in-2.1.html http://www.jinspired.com/products/jxinsight/new-in-2.5.html http://www.jinspired.com/products/jxinsight/new-in-3.0.html http://www.jinspired.com/products/jxinsight/new-in-3.1.html http://www.jinspired.com/products/jxinsight/new-in-3.2.html http://www.jinspired.com/products/jxinsight/new-in-4.0.html http://www.jinspired.com/products/jxinsight/new-in-4.1.html William Louth JXInsight Product Architect JInspired "J2EE tuning, testing and tracing with JXInsight" http://www.jinspired.com

Didn't John Hobson do this first? I used a logging JDBC shim that he put together at HAHT at least 4-5 years ago...
