My Tio Luis roasting a _lechon_, pig, for New Years. This photo was taken by my mother in Puerto Rico. ![](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/photos/124414175-M-1.jpg) Lechon is one of the favorite meats during the Christmas holidays. Actually it's one of the favorite meats ALL the time :) ![el lechon asado](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/photos/124414467-S.jpg)
