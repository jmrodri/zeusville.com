My Tio Luis roasting a _lechon_, pig, for New Years. This photo was taken by my

mother in Puerto Rico.

Lechon is one of the favorite meats during the Christmas holidays. Actually it's one of the favorite meats ALL the time :)

I've only had the experience of eating pig roasted on a spit once. It has to be on of my most cherished memories of food. Where's my invite and when are we going? ;-)
