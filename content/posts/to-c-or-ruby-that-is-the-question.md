I'm trying to decide whether to pick up C again (as it's been almost 13 years since I've done it) or Ruby. I've spent the last 13 years in the Java world, as of late I've been working with python as much as humanly possible. Ruby keeps me in the web side of things, but C would open up a bunch of Linux opportunities which I find interesting. I know one of my [friends](http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/) would say neither go for Erlang :) </thinking>
