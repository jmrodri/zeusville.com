In Java there is a Boolean object which has a nice static method called getBoolean that takes in a String. It returns a primitive boolean. So one would think that the following would print true. ... String foo = "true"; System.out.println( "Value \[" + Boolean.getBoolean( foo ) + "\]" ); ... But getBoolean() does not translate a String into a boolean primitive. It gets the boolean value of a SYSTEM PROPERTY. From the Javadoc: Returns true if and only if the system property named by the argument exists and is equal to the string "true".
