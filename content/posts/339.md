The was a time when everything I sold on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com) would sell.
But it's become mostly businesses selling items at a discount instead of jane
user selling to joe user. This past week I listed 8
[items](http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=ViewListedItems&since=14&userid=zeusman3&include=0&rows=50&sort=3&completed=1)
and only 1 of them sold (Griffin iTrip FM Transmitter) :(

I guess if I wasn't selling junk they would have sold :) but I hate to throw
out stuff that I know others might use, and why not profit a little in the
process. I thought for sure the LSI Logic SCSI card would sell, even the rounded
SCSI cables. But alas, it was nothing but a waste of time and money
(darn listing fees). Oh well, I guess most of these items will simply end up
in the recycle bin.

If they're tech items, trying bringing them into work. We do that here and
then hold swap meets, trading our junk for others' junk that seems more
interesting at the time. ;-)

I spoke too soon, looks like 2 items sold. Someone actually bought the modem.
Go figure.
