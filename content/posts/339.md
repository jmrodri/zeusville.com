The was a time when everything I sold on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com) would sell. But it's become mostly businesses selling items at a discount instead of jane user selling to joe user. This past week I listed 8 [items](http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=ViewListedItems&since=14&userid=zeusman3&include=0&rows=50&sort=3&completed=1) and only 1 of them sold (Griffin iTrip FM Transmitter) :(

I guess if I wasn't selling junk they would have sold :) but I hate to throw out stuff that I know others

might use, and why not profit a little in the process. I thought for sure the LSI Logic SCSI card would sell, even the rounded SCSI cables. But alas, it was nothing but a waste of time and money (darn listing fees). Oh well, I guess most of these items will simply end up in the recycle bin.
