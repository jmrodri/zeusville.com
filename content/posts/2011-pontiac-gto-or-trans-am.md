Rumors have started as to whether the Pontiac coupe based on the Zeta platform, used by the new Camaro, will be a GTO or Trans Am.  I like the color, but I don't care for the proportions.  The Camaro seems to look more like the first-gen, while this looks a lot like the fourth-gen. ![pontiac](http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2007/02/md_trans_am_front_burt2_450.jpg) [SWEET!](http://www.autoblog.com/2007/02/23/should-pontiacs-rwd-coupe-be-the-gto-or-trans-am/)
