Another year younger, and another year wiser. Happy Birthday to my wife who was born on this day. The boys bombarded her this morning with presents and cards. After the boys went to school, we went to have a nice breakfast. Had dinner out tonight at the Olive Garden where we surprised her with the happy birthday celebration and finally went off to Adan's tee-ball game.
