So McCain was supposed to be on Letterman. Apparently McCain called Letterman to cancel his appearance because he was suspending his campaign in light of the economic situation.

Personally, I think McCain is full of it. Letterman asks a good question in this video clip, "why not have your running mate continue with the campaign while you tend to other things?"

While I'm on the topic of McCain, he also wants to reschedule the Presidential debate so he can tend to the economic situation. I applaud him for wanting to take part and do his Senatorial duties. But Barack Obama is right, as president you'll have to do more than one thing you can't just "pause" the world while you deal with something.

Not only does he want to postpone the Presidential debate, but he wants to postpone the VP debate as well. http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/09/mccain-camp-let.html Combine that with the fact that he didn't leave his campaign in Palin's hands, as Letterman pointed out, and it starts to seem like he might not have a lot of faith in Palin's capabilities as VP.
