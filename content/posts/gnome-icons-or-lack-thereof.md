Why aren't there any good Gnome icons? I've searched Google for
[gnome icons](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=gnome+icons&btnG=Google+Search)
and can't seem to find any really cool ones. This site has the most I've seen
so far,[Gnome Icons](http://jimmac.musichall.cz/ikony.php3), but they're still
rather drab. Now xicons.com has some really nice [Windows](http://xp.xicons.com)
and [Mac OS X](http://xicons.com) icons but no Gnome icons or themes. I spent
3 hours trying to convert [this](http://xp.xicons.com/details/748.html) set
from Windows icons (.ico) to PNG (.png) format in separate sizes ranging from
16x16 to 128x128. It was really something I don't want to do again.

Here's what I have so far using some of the icons I converted, and inheriting
my theme from Bluecurve.[](http://www.jroller.com/resources/jmrodri/desktop_snapshot.png)

![jroller desktop snapshot](http://www.jroller.com/resources/jmrodri/desktop_snapshot.png)
The Trash, jmrodri's Home, document, and LimeWire were all replaced. But the
Bluecurve defaults show through in the Terminal icon and the audio player.

Does anyone know where to find high quality Gnome icon themes?
