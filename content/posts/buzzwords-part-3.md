While reading through my blog subscriptions, I stumbled on this link today: [annoying buzzwords](http://gizmodo.com/5360916/what-tech-buzzwords-annoy-you-the-most). I've got a few I'd like to add that drive me nuts (in addition to the posts I made last year: [buzzwords 1](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2008/02/21/buzzwords/), and [buzzwords 2](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2008/03/05/more-annoying-buzzwords/)):

*   geographic affinity

*   clustering

*   federated

I'm sure there are a lot more, but those are the ones that have been grating me lately.

**UPDATE:**: metadata is another one.
