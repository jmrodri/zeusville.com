Tonight my team, the [Dallas Cowboys](http://www.dallascowboys.com/), lost to, dare I say it, _cough_ redskins. I'm sure the Redskins fans are in their glory because this is their Superbowl. I say to them, "enjoy it because this is as close to the Superbowl as you'll be getting!"

Glad you're happy, [GDK](http://gregdek.livejournal.com/36412.html)! Just wait till we go to Landover and exact our revenge.![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/Dallas_Cowboys.svg/438px-Dallas_Cowboys.svg.png "Dallas Cowboys logo")

Howdee -- Just stumbled in here lookin' for game photos. But I have to point out that your Cowboys haven't been doin' too good in Landover these last few years. I would know, I'm a season ticket holder. ALSO want to point out it's after the 'Skins bye week. Odds are T.O. will be suspended by then. Cheers, G.
