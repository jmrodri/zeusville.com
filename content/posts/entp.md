I took the Meyers-Briggs exam almost 10 years ago now, back then I was one of two people that was an ENTP, and I was the only engineer with an E. The majority of the team was ISTJ.

I took the test again, and I'm still an [ENTP](http://www.helloquizzy.com/results/the-long-scientific-personality-test/?fromCGI=1&var_I%2bto%2bE=1&var_N%2bto%2bS=-9&var_F%2bto%2bT=7&var_J%2bto%2bP=13).
