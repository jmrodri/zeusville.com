My mom asked me to order her a new laptop but she was on a budget. So I picked the Dell Inspiron [1501](http://http//www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/inspn_1501?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs) with 1GB RAM and an AMD Sempron 3500+. It came with Vista, but my mom is' not much of a computer person. She still uses Windows 95 on a Pentium 60 :) So the idea of teaching her Windows Vista scared me as I would have long nights trying to support that. I then bought a copy of Windows XP Home, as I figured this would be easier to support over the phone. Then I kept thinking, why not go with Linux? Could it be any harder to support than XP or Vista? Actually, it isn't. I wouldn't have to worry about her machine getting infected with viruses, or any of the other windows type hacks. I found this wonderful site on how to get [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) running on [the Inspiron 1501](http://ubuntu1501.blogspot.com). Everything seems to work: wireless using [ndiswrapper](http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/) drivers, the Canon PIXMA IP6310D USB printer works using drivers from [TurboPrint](http://www.turboprint.info), the display works at the native 1200x800 using open source ATI drivers, though I don't get to use compiz which is fine. Suspend and hibernate work as well. I even got flash, and music support. So far this is a great looking setup. I did opt for a dual boot scenario with Windows XP Home on a 15GB partition, but that's a "just in case". The sad thing is, Ubuntu was easier to install and get working than XP was. :) One last problem I have to solve is the modem. The laptop has a Conexant onboard modem. I'm not sure if my mom will be willing to ditch dialup :) strictly for the price: $4.97/month vs. $25/month for DSL. But the ease of getting on the internet and me supporting here with SSH would make it worthwhile. Next stop is to get my wife, [Liz](http://emrodriguez.wordpress.com/), running Linux as well. Then I'll be Windows FREE at home, sorta, I still run it in [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/) for the few times I buy [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) music.
