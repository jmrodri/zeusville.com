Having been using [Roller](http://www.rollerweblogger.org) for more than a year

now, I decided to try [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com). I must say that my first impression was a great one. Blogger is much easier to use especially the weblog entry, here's a shot of the edit page.

Try leaving a comment to a blogger blog is you don't have a blogger account.

JRoller should - find better css designs. - better and more sandart compatible editors, better editor for comment entry too. Also an editor allows colorized code entry.. - remember next time logic.. otherwise, i prefer jroller over blogger.
