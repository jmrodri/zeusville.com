Happy Anniversary to us. It's our 11th wedding anniversary today. Last night we had a good dinner with Liz' [CBS](http://www.communitybiblestudy.org/) friends and saw the "[King's Speech](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1504320/)". Today the plan is Adan's basketball game then [Red Lobster](http://www.redlobster.com/) for dinner.
