This weekend we drove to Maryland, yes again. While in Maryland I lost my only set of keys for my car. It's yet another sign that it's time for a new car. But getting a set of new keys is $170 compared to a new car :) So we put off the inevitable a little longer. But that was the only bad news from this weekend. The reason we made the trip at all was to see Frank, my father-in-law, through his surgery for prostate cancer. He had the surgery done at [NIH](http://www.nih.gov/) by a surgeon formerly from [John Hopkins](http://www.jhu.edu/). We felt he was in good hands with that combination as opposed to his crappy insurance: [Kaiser](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4183/is_20070402/ai_n18786407) [Permanente](http://legalstuff.kaiserpapers.info/lawsuits.html). Frank is doing well after surgery. He had his entire family present to make sure he was ok. Hopefully he'll be going home tomorrow.
