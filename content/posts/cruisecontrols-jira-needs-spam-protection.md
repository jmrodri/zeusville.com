I was looking to see if my latest [cruisecontrol](http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/) problem was a bug, I stumbled on this [bug](http://jira.public.thoughtworks.org/browse/CC-515) entry, which is in dire need of spam protection:

We do have spam protection now. Unfortunately, we got hit pretty hard a while ago and we haven't had time to cleanup all the old issues. Thanks for pointing this one out! Paul Julius CruiseControl Administrator
