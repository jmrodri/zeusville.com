I was looking to see if my latest [cruisecontrol](http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/) problem was a bug, I stumbled on this [bug](http://jira.public.thoughtworks.org/browse/CC-515) entry, which is in dire need of spam protection: [http://jira.public.thoughtworks.org/browse/CC-515](http://jira.public.thoughtworks.org/browse/CC-515) [![spam](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/spam1.png)](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/spam1.png "spam")
