On Saturday, I attended the [Evil Robot Conference](http://evilrobotconference.wordpress.com/) held at [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com) [HQ](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1801+varsity+drive,+raleigh,+nc&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=49.089956,89.560547&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=A).

I got there a bit late, but I caught the tail end of Clinton Ebadi's talk on "[UnCommon Web](http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw/features.html): A Common Lisp Tale of Continuations, Multimethods,

Metaclasses, and Web Applications". While Lisp can be hard to understand, what you can do with it from a web programming perspective made Java webapps look quite lame considering the amount of code you have to write to make them do anything.

Had lunch at El Cerro with [Kevin Smith](http://twitter.com/kevsmith), from [Hypothetical Labs](http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/), and a few other folks attending the conference. A good time was had by all, and the salsa was quite spicy but oh so good today :)

After lunch, I sat through Dan DeMaggio's "Anti-databases (NoSQL): Where they came from and where theyâ€™re going". I learned a lot of alternatives to the old school single database setup. There's a lot of cool stuff out there for this such as [redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/), [Cassandra](http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/), [couchdb](http://couchdb.apache.org/), [BigTable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable).

Dan's talk was followed by Kevin's "Intro to Erlang" which was most excellent as well. Kevin seemed very comfortable talking and definitely knows his stuff. Great job!

Last but not least, I got to hear what [BRTFS](http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) was from Josef Bacik. Very cool stuff, most of the time I forget how much cool stuff goes into OS development compared to the webapps I do for a living.

All in all, it was a great day long conference. I hope we can make it at least a yearly event.

PS. Sorry I missed your talk Max :) and thanks for the donuts.
