[This](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aj9gCo9Pr58g&refer=home) totally sucks, as a [Vonage](http://www.vonage.com) user, I'm wondering what will happen to Vonage. I've saved a lot of money on my telephone usage: average $21 compared to $55+ with [Sprint](http://www.embarq.com) (now Embarq).

> U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton approved Verizon's request curtailing the service today, sending Vonage shares to a record low. Hilton, in Alexandria, Virginia, said he won't sign the order before a hearing in two weeks on Vonage's request for a stay. A jury found March 8 that Vonage infringed three patents and said it should pay Verizon $58 million.

:(

If Vonage has to shutdown, I might have to go with

[TimeWarner cable's digital phone](http://www.timewarnercable.com/nc/products/digitalphone/default.html) or try [sunrocket](http://www.sunrocket.com) assuming they don't have the same patent issue.

I hope Vonage can figure this out even if it means a rate increase, as I'm still under $55 per month.
