I've started watching [TopGear](http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/index.shtml?survey=no&url=www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/index.shtml&site=topgear&js=no) on BBC America. This show blows all American car shows away. They do some crazy stuff, and really **drive** their cars unlike Motorweek and others which just tool around local roads. Another thing is that [TopGear](http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/index.shtml?survey=no&url=www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/index.shtml&site=topgear&js=no) drives their cars FAST! I'm addicted.

Fifth Gear is not bad either, and it is available free (5 minute episodes) using Joost, IPTV on Windows and OS X.

It's amazing you guys are only getting Top Gear now. For a country full of motoring fans I'm suprised they didn't move earlier. I've loved it since the new format started a few years back and they really push the boat out. Worth having a look at some clips on You Tube. There's some great stuff on there.

Fantastic show, just finished watching the last season myself. It's even entertaining enough that the mrs enjoys it too. Quite a story about Richard Hammond's crash last year.
