I've started watching [TopGear](http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/index.shtml?survey=no&url=www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/index.shtml&site=topgear&js=no) on BBC America. This show blows all American car shows away. They do some crazy stuff, and really **drive** their cars unlike Motorweek and others which just tool around local roads. Another thing is that [TopGear](http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/index.shtml?survey=no&url=www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/index.shtml&site=topgear&js=no) drives their cars FAST! I'm addicted.
