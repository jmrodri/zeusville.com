If your system uses XFree86 4.3.0 or higher and you want to use a snazzy alpha-channeled mouse cursor theme, here's how you do it:

1\. Create a directory in your home called .icons. This is the directory defined by the Freedesktop.org standards as the place for user-defined icon themes.

2\. Place the cursor theme directory into ~/.icons. The directory should have the form ~/.icons/THEME\_NAME/cursors.

3\. With either gconftool or gconf-editor, set the value of /desktop/gnome/peripherals/mouse/cursor\_theme to the name of the new theme.

4\. If you use another window manager or desktop environment, you can also place a line like this in ~/.Xdefaults:

```
    Xcursor.theme:THEME\_NAME

```or you can set the XCURSOR\_THEME environment variable in your startup scripts.

You can find cursor themes at the following addresses:
