Dear Interwebs, Back in [Sept of 2008](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2008/09/21/time-warner-can-kiss-my/), I was sick of Time Warner Cables crappy DVR but I didn't follow through on my threat of switching to something else. Now I have a new HDTV and the Time Warner Cable HD-DVR box and it is worse than the SD DVR box I had from them.

*   slow menus
*   doesn't buffer the channel it is on anymore
*   HD box has really dumb recording, two shows on the same channel back to back and try to record another one on a different channel, the box thinks there's a conflict. But the same channel shows are back to back, it only needs one tuner for that.
*   the UI is horrible

I know a lot of folks are happy with their [TiVo](http://www.tivo.com/)'s, but the 'no DVR fee' of the [Moxi](http://moxi.com/us/home.html). So do any of you Interwebbers have a Moxi and if so, how do you like it? Feel free to leave a comment. Thanks!
