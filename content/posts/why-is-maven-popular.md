So why is it that among Java folks [maven](http://maven.apache.org) is so popular? The pom.xml is an abomination, it's is difficult to maintain and I've had simpler [ant](http://ant.apache.org/) build files. I know maven has dependency resolution which you can get with ant using [Ivy](http://www.jaya.free.fr/ivy/). Maven supports multiple projects, but that can be done with ant as well. So what is it that makes maven so popular? skeptical minds want to know.
