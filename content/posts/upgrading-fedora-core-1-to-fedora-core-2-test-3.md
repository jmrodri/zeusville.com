I've just finished burning my 4 ISOs of Core 2 test 3. I'm going to upgrade my Core 1 installation, I'm dynig to try out the new GNOME with Nautilus upgrades as well as the 2.6 kernel.

Seeing as it's 10:30 PM EST, I'm going to put this off until this weekend. I will post with detailed experiences.
