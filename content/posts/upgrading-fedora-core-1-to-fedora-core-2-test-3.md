I've just finished burning my 4 ISOs of Core 2 test 3. I'm going to upgrade my Core 1 installation, I'm dynig to try out the new GNOME with Nautilus upgrades as well as the 2.6 kernel.

Seeing as it's 10:30 PM EST, I'm going to put this off until this weekend. I will post with detailed experiences.

**Debian** would've been a better choice.

Yeh - post up how it goes; it might be useful.  
I'll try and do the same thing for my installations, eventually.
