After a failed Fedora 26 upgrade on Friday, I spent the day trying to recover a corrupted rpm database, missing packages, not booting into gdm. I recovered it enough to boot, but it's really in a weird state.

While preparing to backup my homedir, I was go through files I no longer needed. I've been cargo culting my homedir since I started working at Red Hat in 2004.

Here are the oldest files from day one:

```

Go through my homedir is like a digital archaeological dig :)
