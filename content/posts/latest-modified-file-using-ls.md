This morning I wanted to find the latest files I modifed in a directory. My first thought was to use ls -l then pipe that to awk or sort, in short I was going in a very convoluted direction (probably cuz I write Java for a living) :) My second thought was I bet ls can already get me there. I was close, ls got me most of the way, a pipe to head got me the files/directories I wanted:```
ls -ct1 | head -10

```
