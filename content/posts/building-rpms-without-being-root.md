I got tired of having to become root to install a src.rpm and to build it. Turns out a little magic in `$HOME/.rpmmacros` will do the trick. Do the following: `mkdir -p $HOME/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS} echo "%home %(echo $HOME)" >> $HOME/.rpmmacros echo "%_topdir %{home}/rpmbuild" >> $HOME/.rpmmacros` Now when you install a src.rpm it will go to `$HOME/rpmbuild/` instead of `/usr/src/redhat/`. That's it.
