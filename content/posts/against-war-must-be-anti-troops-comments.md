Are you serious? Troops (i.e. soldiers) have only one \*real\* job- to fight. If there is no battle or war to be fought, they don't really have a job to do. Therefore, if you are against war, you are against our troops having jobs. Furthermore, you are obviously a communist since jobs are basis of capitalism. Actually, I am being sarcastic. I have no idea why people believe that. They are idiots. In fact, quite the opposite is true. If you really, truly are "for the troops", you do everything damn thing to keep them safe so that if and when the time comes, they will do everything to keep us safe.
