Earlier this week I [complained](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/printing-photos-suck/) about printing photos from Linux on my inkjet. Most folks told me to use a regular photo place for printing my pictures NOT an inkjet. What I didn't mention in the post was the reason I was even bothering to print them on my inkjet. I needed 3 pictures for my son's homework and it was too late to take them to CVS or other photo place. My frustration was that in most cases Linux just works for me, this was not one of those cases though. I usually just upload my pictures to [smugmug.com](http://www.smugmug.com/) and I use their printing service for my photos.
