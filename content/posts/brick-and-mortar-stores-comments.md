IKEA shipping prices are not just shipping, they're stock picking too. Remember, part of the reason IKEA stuff is cheap is that you do the stock picking and assembly yourself. Since they're not set up to have staff do the stock picking efficiently, they charge way more to have someone do it for you than a 'typical' operation would. If you go to IKEA and do the stock picking yourself, but have them deliver it, they charge a lot less than if you order it for delivery online (still a moderate whack, but 1/2 the online delivery price or less). For me a cab still works out better, but hey.

I highly encourage you to spend as much of your money as possible on Amazon. :)

Ha! Just ran into this. I want a specific Brother laser printer, and with all the locals- Best Buy, Office Depot, Staples- they all have it as web only, and it's a pretty cheap model, the kind they usually have in store. If I have to get it online, amazon has it cheapest. Gads, they're all such loser run outfits. And, yeah, I've had several hefty furniture items from amazon with free shipping. Even with them collecting sales tax for my state they are a better deal 90% of the time.
