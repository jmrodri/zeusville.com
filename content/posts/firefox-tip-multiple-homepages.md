This might have been around since Mozilla added tabbed browsing, but [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) has the ability to have multiple pages start as your home page. For instance, when I open up Firefox, I want one tab to go straight to [Google](http://www.google.com) and the other to my [blog](http://www.jroller.com/page/jmrodri/). Here's how you do it: 1) Start Firefox and setup the tabs to the sites you want 2) Open the Preferences page: Edit -> Preferences -> General. 3) Click the "User Current Pages" button. That's it. Notice that it simply puts in a PIPE (|) character between each URL.
