This might have been around since Mozilla added tabbed browsing, but [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) has the ability to have multiple pages start as your home page.

For instance, when I open up Firefox, I want one tab to go straight to [Google](http://www.google.com) and the other to my [blog](http://www.jroller.com/page/jmrodri/). Here's how you do it:

1) Start Firefox and setup the tabs to the sites you want

2) Open the Preferences page:

Edit -> Preferences -> General.

3) Click the "User Current Pages" button.

That's it. Notice that it simply puts in a PIPE (|) character between each URL.

Now this works well at startup, but not so much when you press the Home button which promptly opens two tabs, and if you're currently in a tab the first homepage appears there then a new tab is opened the second homepage.
