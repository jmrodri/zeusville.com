Ha! I love that. I do believe organized chaos works better for some people, so I say "go with it". I am definitely on the opposite end of the spectrum, but I don't take hours to make my work/living space tidy, either. Perhaps there is some intense cleaning to start and putting everything in its place - but after that its really just a bit of routine maintenance!
