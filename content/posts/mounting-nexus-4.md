For some reason you can't mount the Nexus 4 as a drive. SMH. MTP support seems to be ok in Fedora 19, these instructions worked for me.

Almost all newer phones don't support USB storage now because it's really hard to manage the access. On F18 using Gnome, my Nexus 4 automounts and shows up in the file manager without me doing anything. It's certainly possible that at some point I installed an extra package that made it work, but I didn't have to do anything special beyond that.
