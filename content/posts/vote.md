Ah yes, please go out and vote. Your vote DOES count even if your state leans towards a different candidate (like they do here in NC, lean to the right). Also, you must vote if you want to complain or praise about politics in the future. I really dislike when folks don't vote and complain about the current administration. If you don't like it, vote against it. If you do like it, vote for it (except I don't think anyone is happy with the current administration).

Now, I didn't want to rewrite what I sent out once before. So here it is again.

I've already made up my mind for the election. I'm voting against George "dumbass" Bush and his cronies. As well, as reevaluating who I elect to Congress since they are equally important since they make the laws in this country. Most folks only care about who they elect for president. But congressman, judges, senators, councilman, everyone is important. Like Liz said, please educate yourself on your candidates.

It's amazing how much the Bush Administration has managed to piss off the rest of the world with the attack on Iraq. He had a prime opportunity after Sept. 11th to get the world behind us and leading a well planned fight against terrorism. I truly believe that Al-Qaeda is behind all of this terrorism and the Bush administration has lost focus of this. Actually, they never had such focus, they were too busy planning to attack Iraq from day one of his presidency.

The other thing that has annoyed me about this election year is the topic of Vietnam service and "flip-flop". Personally, the Democrats should stop talking about Bush' Vietnam record because we had the same type of president when Clinton was running. But Clinton was much smarter than Bush. Bush is a "received" wisdom type of person. One who gets his wisdom from others only. In contrast, Clinton would not only listen to what his colleagues had to say, but also study and try to understand the problem he was asked to solve.

As far as the flip-flopping goes, most folks will change their minds on topics if it doesn't meet their criteria. For instance, what commonly occurs with bills in Congress is there is typically one major piece to be voted on i.e. funding the war, etc. When Kerry was "for" the bill, it was with a caveat that the tax cuts be rescinded. When they were not, he voted against the bill. This is called LOGIC. Changing one's mind isn't really a bad trait. I personally think that one who would stick to a decision that is wrong is worse. But also, Bush has had his "flip-flop" moments. Against the 9/11 commission, for the 911 commission, opposes dept of homeland security, then supports it, goes to war against Iraq without UN, now wants their help. That's just a small list of "flip-flops". Like I stated earlier, that's not necessarily bad. He obviously realized that somethings weren't such a bad idea after all. But don't accuse others of "flip-flopping", those of us who think often change our minds when we realize we were wrong.

Now I'm on a roll, another thing that annoys me is the attack that John Kerry already has millions of dollars of spending planned. What the do you call paying for the war? Paying for tax cuts? Do people honestly believe these are FREE? Nothing in this world is FREE (free as in no price tag)! There is always a price not always a monetary price, but a price nonetheless. Just look at the war in Iraq? Not only is it costing us billions of dollars, but also in American lives. We have also managed to piss off the rest of the world which could easily turn around and ask for UN sanctions against the US? Now is this worth the price of admission?

I, for one, do not think that Bush is the right person for this country. He may have been able to run Texas, but not a country. And yes, Texas is NOT a country.
