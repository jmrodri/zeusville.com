One of the biggest drawbacks to being a software engineer and computer enthusiast, is that you become the de facto computer expert in the family. I spent a good part of today setting up a [Linksys WAP54G access point](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1126536803676&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper) in wireless repeater mode.

The [Linksys WRE54G range expander](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115416829757&packedargs=site%3DUS&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper) bit the bullet because of lightning, so it needed replacing. A new one would be [$81 at newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833124037) whereas the WAP54G was on sale for [$56 at newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833124012). I have had good luck with Linksys products, but lately their ["easy setup"](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Promotion_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1121874562335&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper) makes my life more difficult. I find it far easier to browse to the device, set the configuration and go. The easy setup works for basic stuff, but for more advanced things like making the access point work in repeater mode not so much.

After about 3 hours of trial and error, and several forum searches, I was able to get the access point to connect to the wireless router ([a Linksys WRT54G](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1149562300349&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper)). I got great wireless connection downstairs almost 90% before it was typically 30%. But this access point wasn't for me, it was for my father-in-law. So I'll have to spend at least another 2 hours on the phone walking him through what I did to get it to work with his Linksys router. I'll post on that later this week.

I'm sure many of you computer geeks out there can relate to being tech support, network admin, hardware specialists for your extended family :)
