I gave up dealing with [Eforcity.com](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2008/08/11/eforcity-sucks/) and ordered my SATA controller from [Newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com), which is where I should've gone in the first place. I ordered the card Tuesday night choosing regular UPS Ground shipping. It arrived today, Thursday! You can't beat that service and speed. OH, the best part was they got my order right the **FIRST** time.
