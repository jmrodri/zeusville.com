The boys and I have been bonding by watching the Star Wars movies. So far we've seen Episodes IV, V, VI, I, II, and Clone Wars Volume One. I ordered Volume Two which should be here soon. Sorry, I digressed, I really wanted to post this picture I found on nerdtests.com which I liked: ![Clone War Veteran](http://www.nerdtests.com/picsarea/3088fede570d5faae402c86d18ae5dc9.jpg)
