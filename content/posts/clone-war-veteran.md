The boys and I have been bonding by watching the Star Wars movies. So far we've seen Episodes IV, V, VI, I, II, and Clone Wars Volume One. I ordered Volume Two which should be here soon. Sorry, I digressed, I really wanted to post this picture I found on nerdtests.com which I liked:

HEHEHEHE! Check out the 'Chad Vader' series on you tube... it starts getting old by the 5th or 6th episode but the first one is pretty funny :)
