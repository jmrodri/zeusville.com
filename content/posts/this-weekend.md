We did a lot this weekend

*   Installed [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) Feisty Fawn on my mom's [Dell Inspirion 1501](http://ubuntu1501.blogspot.com).  It's not [Fedora,](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/) but it's more usable for her.

*   I took Adan & Marco to see [TMNT](http://tmnt.warnerbros.com/) on Saturday morning.  They got to ride in the "black car".

*   Saturday afternoon, I took Adan to a friend's birthday party at [Chuck E. Cheese's](http://www.chuckecheese.com/).

*   Adan accompanied me to [Best Buy](http://www.bestbuy.com) to buy a [wireless mouse](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=6844212&st=microsoft+mouse&type=product&id=1093467913313) for my mom's laptop.

*   Sunday, was Palm Sunday, so we went to mass. Luckily it was a beautiful day, 73 degrees.

*   Then after church, I took Marco to one of his friend's birthday party at [Pump It Up](http://www.pumpitupparty.com/) in Wake Forest.

What I didn't do was:

*   cut and trim the lawn

*   change the oil in the car

*   attempt to figure out what's wrong with the car's cooling that causes the A/C not to kick on.
