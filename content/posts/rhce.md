Yesterday I passed the Red Hat Certified Engineer ([RHCE](https://www.redhat.com/certification/rhce/)) exam. I am now officially an [RHCE](https://www.redhat.com/certification/rhce/)! You can [verify it here](https://www.redhat.com/training/certification/verify/?rhce_cert_display:certno=805008586930012&rhce_cert_display:verify_cb=Verify).
