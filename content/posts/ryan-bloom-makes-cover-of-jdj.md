A former co-worker of mine at Red Hat, Ryan Bloom, has made the cover of Java Developer's Journal with his article on "Debugging JDBC with a Logging Driver". It's a great article on creating a JDBC driver which logs all of the SQL calls being made. I use it on my project now and it is extremely valuable.

CONGRATS RYAN!
