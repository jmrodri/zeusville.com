I completed my first trade on goozex.com and I received [Forza Motorsports](http://www.goozex.com/trading/asp/itemdetail.asp?item=9322) for XBOX today. This game ROCKS! As a car lover and now a new gaming freak, this game is awesome. I got to drive a 2004 [Pontiac GTO](http://www.pontiac.com/gto/index.jsp) and a 2006 [Corvette Z06](http://www.chevrolet.com/corvette/#corvette-z06) and I totally botched both of them :) This game is very realistic, now I need [gaming chair,](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000K9Q5UK/ref=nosim/?tag=nextag-sg-20&creative=380333&creativeASIN=B000K9Q5UK&linkCode=asn) a steering wheel and gas pedals :)
