Yesterday, Liz ran a multi-family yard sale which was held at our house. She did an awesome job in the planning from creating bright, large signs; getting change from the bank to be able to make change for the shoppers; and hosting the yard sale at the house.

The yard sale was from 7:30am to noon, but there were some diehard shoppers here at 6:45am. And they are ruthless, while Liz and her friends were moving the sellable items out of the garage, customers were trying to "buy" stuff in my garage, "Is this for sale? How about this?"

Around 9:00 am I peered out the window to see our block full of cars all heading to our yard sale. It's a really interesting phenomenon. The signs were only put out Friday afternoon as the only advertisement but that was enough to garner a huge crowd. There were all walks of life from old retirees looking for a nik-nak, to new mothers looking to buy some great baby stuff, to Hispanic construction workers looking for a nice toy for their children. It was a great sight.

I've always wondered what would sell well at a yard sale, and found the answer yesterday. Baby equipment and clothing goes really well, as do Disney videos. Cassette tapes and CDs work well too. What doesn't work is OLD computer equipment, that's best left to [eBay](http://www.ebay.com). I tried hard to ditch my [IBM](http://www.ibm.com) PS/2 Model 77 but no takers especially since most folks wanted a good starter computer to play games. The PS/2 is NOT a gaming machine especially with no sound card. It would make a great firewall or some other low powered Linux server.
