Drooling over [moonpup's](http://moonpup.blogspot.com/2009/06/hows-your-isp-stack-up.html) EDU internet speed, I figured I'd check mine out.

A friend of mine gets a nice 30Mbps up and down with Verizon FIOS in Oregon.

<sarcasam>Time Warner offers me great speeds! Way to go Time Warner.</sarcasam>

You're not alone. I've got TWC in Akron, Ohio and they blow too.
