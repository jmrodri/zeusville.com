Since ABC moved Grey's Anatomy to Thursday nights, it's screwing up my DVR schedule. I want to record CSI:, Grey's Anatomy, and The OC all of which are on a 9pm EST.

Right now CSI: and Grey's Anatomy are winning out. I'll probably have to watch The OC real time on a second TV or it might be time to build a MythTV box.
