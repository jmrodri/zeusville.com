I'm starting to lose track of how long it's been since I've had my car. I think it's been 3 weeks already. It is Tuesday (what's left of it anyway) and the car remains in the shop as of this morning. Looks like the final piece was being worked on today, the AC. All the other issues seemed to have been fixed.  I'm really hoping and praying it'll be ready tomorrow. But knowing my luck it'll be longer. :(
