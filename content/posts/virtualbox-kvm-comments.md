If you do not mind, here is how to bridge your network card: http://blog.bodhizazen.net/linux/virt-manager-bridged-networking/ I also have a blog on how to "bridge" wireless cards (search my blog if interested, one link is enough here). In terms of KVM vs VBox - It depends on what you want to do exactly. VBox- better for desktops and desktop integration (if you want those things). KVM- better for servers (IMO).

Can I ask why you moved? Also, if you used the same host, can you tell us about relative performance kvm vs virtualbox? -Andy

Yeah I would be interested in how VirtualBox stacks up against KVM on Fedora. I am thinking about doing the same, but VirtualBox seems like it has many features and a much more polished GUI, settings, etc. etc.

Does this work with that "other" operating system too? I had serious problems installing XP under KVM, so I have to use BOTH on my system and I would like to dump Virtual Box if I can.

The short answer is no, BSOD.

Everything worked for me as you've laid out here, however the deal-breaker came when I realized there was no immediate option to use bridged networking. I use Windows XP as a VM under VirtualBox so that I can use software like VMware vSphere Client and MS Outlook. I can't connect to my domain if I can't use the same subnet as eth0...

This might work though... http://www.howtoforge.com/virtualization-with-kvm-on-a-fedora-11-server :)
