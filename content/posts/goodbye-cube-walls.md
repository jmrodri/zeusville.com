For the past 5 years I've had what I think is a bad ass cubicle which is more like shared office. The walls are at least 8 feet height with sliding doors with whiteboards on them. I loved this setup because when i want to get something done and isolate myself, I can simply slide the door closed. If I want to have a small pow-wow, I can invite folks into my cube and again slide the doors close. The cubes are not completely private as the walls do not reach to the ceiling, and you share it with another person: your cubie.

But for some reason, unbeknownst to me we are moving to shorter cubicles with no doors, no whiteboards, and conversation HELL. I am told by some that the purpose is to increase communication which I could probably believe if the entire team was co-located. But our team is geographically diverse and the folks that are co-located are not necessarily on the same team. So one groups chatter will affect another groups chatter. I just wish I could make sense of it all.

I guess I'm realizing in my old age that I dislike change, especially that which I did not initiate. Maybe if I tap my ruby red shoes, I can get back to Kansas :)
