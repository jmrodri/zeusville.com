I think I've found my iTunes replacement: [Amazon's MP3 store](http://www.amazon.com/mp3) + [Banshee](http://banshee-project.org/Main_Page) + [iPod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod#Models) is an awesome combination. The only thing that is missing is integration between [Banshee](http://banshee-project.org/Main_Page) and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/mp3), now that would be an [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) killer! Hrm I smell a project :) Just another example of how [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora) can make a great desktop.
