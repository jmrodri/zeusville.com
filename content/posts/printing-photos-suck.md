Tonight I lost the battle with printing a picture from Fedora 9 to my Canon S750 color inkjet. The problem wasn't that it would not print, but it would print the picture way to dark and very slow. After spending almost 2 hours trying various things and drivers, I punted and booted up my crusty old Windows XP partition. Printed it right in 10 minutes. Damn I hate when that happens because I NEVER need freakin Windows. Maybe I'll dig a little deeper when I'm not tired and annoyed at the computer.
