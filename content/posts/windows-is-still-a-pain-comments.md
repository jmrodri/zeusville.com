I'm really impressed with Mac's "copy settings from your old mac" tool, that can use either a Time Machine backup or a Firewire connection. Anaconda doing that would be nice, though I question whether video and such would actually work with old X-configs and what other dragons are lurking.

Hey I am doing this for my parents right now. I wish they ahd a tool like the Mac because it would make so much easier. One thing I did like was that it nags me to set up backups for the box.
