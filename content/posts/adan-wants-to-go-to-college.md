This morning Ad√°n put on his Dr. Seuss backpack and said, "I want to go to college." Liz & I bursted out laughing because it was SOOOOOO CUTE! He promptly said, "Don't laugh at me" so we explained we weren't laughing AT him.

He then said, "Go to college, on blue bus like [Steve](http://www.steveswebpage.com/)". This is a reference to Steve the host of [Blue's Clues](http://www.nickjr.com/home/shows/blue/index.jhtml) who left for "college".
