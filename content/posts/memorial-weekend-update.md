I had a great Memorial weekend. My parents came down from Maryland to visit on Saturday. That night we went to the [Carolina Mudcats](http://gomudcats.com) game, the weather was perfect warm but not humid and most importantly no  rain. Sunday my brother and nephew came up from Charlotte. They brought their slip and slide, while not entirely the warmest weather on Sunday, the kids still enjoyed splashing around on it. For dinner that night, I grilled hamburgers, hot dogs, and some chicken breasts. On the last day of the weekend, Monday, my parents left early to avoid traffic (but they still hit it anyway), and we just hung out. The boys watched [E.T. - the Extra Terrestrial](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/) for the first time, and with all the hype behind the new Indiana Jones movies, we let them watch I[ndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/). I'm sure they'll want to watch the other tree to catch up. Maybe near mid June I can take them to see the latest edition. The funny part was that Marco said, "he sounds like Han Solo", and he mentioned the guy on the new movie, [Shia LaBeouf](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0479471/), sounds like Sam from Transformers, which as you may or may not know is the same actor. Now Tuesday rolled around and I'm back at work and Adan is back at school. Marco is already on summer vacation until late July when he begins kindergarten.
