A few weeks ago we took a [trip to Maryland](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/06/26/trip-to-maryland/). While there, my dad & I took the boys to the park. Here are some pictures: Too bad this first picture turned out blurry. My little Canon S60 isn't very good when zooming in, or I guess I should say I'm not very good taking pictures when zooming in :) [![abuelo and his grandsons](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/photos/167359247-S.jpg)](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/photos/167359247-L.jpg) [![](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/photos/167359840-S.jpg)](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/photos/167359840-L.jpg) [![](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/photos/167373356-S.jpg)](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/photos/167373356-L.jpg) [![](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/photos/167361290-S.jpg)](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/photos/167361290-L.jpg) [More pictures](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/gallery/3069991/1/167361290)
