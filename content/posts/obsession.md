I sometimes become obsessed by technology. If it's not playing games on the Xbox, or hanging out on the computer, or doing car related stuff, it's talking about those items ad nauseum. :) But I don't think I'll ever be as obsessed as this [guy](http://www.corsasport.co.uk/board/viewthread.php?tid=347865&page=1). He washed and waxed his car for a week straight, and had a specialist analize the paint with a microscope. He even used $7,118.00! [Zymol Royale](http://zymol.com/shop/item.asp?PID=1378&scID=25) wax. At least it's a good investment:
