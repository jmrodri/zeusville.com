I've made the switch to [Mozilla Firebird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/) on both Windows and Linux. After using Netscape for many years, I made the switch to Mozilla. But I found that it has become bloated especially compared to the speed of Firebird.

If you haven't tried [Firebird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/) give it a try.
