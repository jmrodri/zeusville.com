I got a [Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Touch-light/dp/B007OZNZG0/ref=sr_tr_sr_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1360250648&sr=1-1&keywords=kindle+paperwhite) this past Christmas. I'm not much of a book reader but for 2013 I wanted to read more. As a James Bond fan (I own the Blu-ray box set too :) and the recent Amazon James Bond book sale ($1.99 each for the Kindle versions), I bought all 14 books. I know not that interesting, but I FINALLY finished the first book: ["Casino Royale"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008L40NT0/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title). The one thing I noticed about Bond in "Casino Royale" was that he wasn't as ruthless as he was in the movies. I guess they have to have a lot more killing in the movies to keep folks interested, and it could have been the time when the book was written, 1953. If you are a James Bond fan, I recommend checking out the books. Next book is an actual paperback, also a gift, titled ["Team Geek A Software Developer's Guide to Working Well with Others"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1449302440/ref=mp_s_a_1?qid=1360251424&sr=8-1&pi=SL75) so far so good. It's quite entertaining.
