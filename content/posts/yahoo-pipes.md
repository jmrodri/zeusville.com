I really like the Flickr widget on [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com), and as a [Smugmug](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com) user I wanted to use that feed in there as well. This weekend I started playing with [Yahoo! pipes](http://http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/) and merged my [Flickr feed](http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=33205801@N00&lang=en-us&format=rss_200) with my [Smugmug feed](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/hack/feed.mg?Type=nicknameRecentPhotos&Data=familiarodriguez&format=rss200). But when I tried to use that feed with the Flickr widget, I either got just the title of the images or the "More Photos" link. I opened a [forum topic](http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic.php?id=12330&page&replies=1#post-88740) to see if I can find out what the widget is lookig for in the feed.
