Marco has been begging for a fish. His class has a fish that they take care of and he wanted one for the house. So today I took Marco go Aquarium Outfitters here in Wake Forest. We bought a 2.5 gallon fish tank kit, some blue gravel, fish food, and 3 guppies (2 males & 1 female).

I filmed the fish swimming around.

Guppies generally need to be two females per every male, because the males will hassle the female to death trying to mate.

I guess that's what happened. The fish have been gone for almost a year now :)

I'm so sorry for responding over a year late :( we bought the tank at a local pet store. It was part of a starter kit. Sorry I don't remember what brand it was.
