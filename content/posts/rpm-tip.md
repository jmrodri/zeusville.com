I was writing a spec file today, yes I like writing them, and wondered what macros were defined. I looked in `/etc/rpm/` but couldn't find the one I was looking for. But as we all know, man is your friend, a quick `'man rpm'` revealed `--showrc`.

`rpm --showrc` will dump out the config including macros and their values.
