[![](http://www.goozex.com/trading/ports/0/images/default/logoG.png "goozex")](http://www.goozex.com/referral.asp?idr=4507116230) Do you have a bunch video games which you don't play and would like to trade? I did too, so I joined [Goozex.com](http://www.goozex.com/referral.asp?idr=4507116230). Unlike other trading sites which try to match you with someone willing to trade a specific item or sites that are basically just bulletin boards. Goozex assigns point values to each game you trade which you can then use to get other games. There is a slight charge of $1 per trade. It's a great way to get rid of your game and in my opinion a better value than what you get by trading in your games to Amazon or Gamestop.
