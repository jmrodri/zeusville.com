My one complaint about [python](http://www.python.org/) is having to write [self](http://docs.python.org/tut/node11.html#SECTION0011400000000000000000). all the time. I could do some chicanery and make [self implicit](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/362305). But I doubt I'll do that.  I'll use [python](http://www.python.org) as it was meant be used. :)

I was hoping it would be gone in Python 3000 as I thought it was a huge hack that shouldn't have survived this long, but reading the changelog it doesn't look like self is going anywhere. Then I actually looked up why they have it there in the first place and I felt better.
