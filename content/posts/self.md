My one complaint about [python](http://www.python.org/) is having to write [self](http://docs.python.org/tut/node11.html#SECTION0011400000000000000000). all the time. I could do some chicanery and make [self implicit](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/362305). But I doubt I'll do that.Â  I'll use [python](http://www.python.org) as it was meant be used. :)
