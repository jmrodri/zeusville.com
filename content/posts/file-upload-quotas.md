![](http://jroller.com/resources/jmrodri/jroller_files.png) What the hell is this? When did [JRoller](http://www.jroller.com) start having upload quotas? I wonder if this is related to the [upgrade](http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20040529) to 0.9.9? ARGH! This is a pain. **UPDATE!** Uploading of files has been fixed since this blog entry.
