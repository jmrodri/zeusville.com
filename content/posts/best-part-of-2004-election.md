The best part of the 2004 election is that [George W. Bush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush) can NOT run again [EVER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).

Also, the front runner for the 2008 Republican seems to be [Rudy Giuliani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani).
