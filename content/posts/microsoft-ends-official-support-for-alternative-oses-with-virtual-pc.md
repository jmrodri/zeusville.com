Microsoft has dropped support for alternative OSes.

"However, the new version will no longer offer official support for BSD Unix, Linux, NetWare or Solaris on Intel."

"Instead, Microsoft is focusing on enabling Windows Server 2003 administrators to run Windows NT 4 applications on their updated servers. This, in turn, will help NT users migrate to Windows Server 2003. Technically, Virtual PC officially enables users to run XP, W2K, NT Workstation, 98, 95, ME, Windows 3.1, and OS/2 VMs on XP, W2K, NT 4 SP6 or Server 2003."

Now what use is a Virtual PC program that only runs Windows? Why would I ever want to run Windows NT on a new Windows box? How many applications out there are not updated immediately when a new version of Windows is released?

It's really no surprise, we all knew this was going to happen when they purchased Connectix.
