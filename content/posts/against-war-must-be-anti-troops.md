Why is it that if one is against war that they must not support our troops? Personally, I wish we never have to go to war, that way we don't put our troops in harms way. There are times like after Pearl Harbor when the US entered into World War II, and after 9/11 when we attacked Afghanistan. But I feel that the Iraq war was unnecessary and put our troops in unnecessary danger. But just because I don't think we should be in Iraq, does NOT mean I don't support our troops. It's those very same troops that allow me to have the freedom to write this commentary. And why I "fight" here to bring the troops home to their families to enjoy the freedom they fight for.
