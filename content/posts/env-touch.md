I got my new phone today. I replaced my Samsung SCH-U740 flip phone

with a new [enV Touch](http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=4787).

The phone has a bright touch screen which is pretty easy to use. I like how it has a touch screen QWERTY keyboard when you turn the phone horizontal. You can also open it to get a physical QWERTY keyboard.

So far it's a great upgrade over the Samsung which has been extremely reliable for the past 2 years. Hell the phone is still in great shape. I highly recommend the enV Touch.
