This afternoon, I was chilling out and watched ["Varsity Blues"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139699/)![](http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/81/56/31m.jpg). It has [Paul Walker](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908094/) (from [Fast and the Furious](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0232500/)), [James Van Der Beek](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004735/) (from [Dawson's Creek](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118300/) fame), and [Ali Larter](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005123/) (best known for [Final Destination](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195714/) ok we all know it's really from the whipcream bikini scene in Varsity Blues).
