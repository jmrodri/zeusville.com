The weather this morning (around 8:10am) was great. I took the t-tops off of the Trans Am, rolled down the windows, cranked up the stereo (Linkin Park - Hybrid Theory) and cruised on into work.

My favorite part of my commute is where US1 (Capital Blvd) becomes Dawson St. in Raleigh. At well above the speed limit (50 in a 35) this becomes a quick right turn, then left.
