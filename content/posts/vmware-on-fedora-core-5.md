I installed [VMware Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/) 5.5.1 on [Fedora Core 5](http://fedora.redhat.com/) x86\_64 so that I could run [Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/default.mspx) inside Fedora. I have a few items that motivated me to do this:

*   My kids like to play on noggin.com
    
*   I love [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/)
    
*   Quicken works better
    

My boys have started using the computer to play on noggin.com and playhouse disney.

There's not 64-bit flashplugin for FC5, and dual booting is a PITA. So now I can

allow the boys to play using Windows without the need for a dedicated Windows partition.

I used to work at a Windows shop where I got hooked on [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/). So I've amassed

a large amount of music purchased from iTunes which I can't play using gtkpod.

And [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) in [CrossOver Office](http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice/) just isn't ready yet.

And finally [Quicken](http://quicken.intuit.com/quicken_products.jhtml?priorityCode=3948700000&lid=intuitnav) just works better in Windows than in WINE.

[VMware](http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/) offers a great UI and is quite easy to use. I was up and running

in a [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/) instance in a day.

Here's a screenshot:
