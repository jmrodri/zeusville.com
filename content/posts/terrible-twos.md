Adán is in his full defiant stage. It's a constant battle to get him to sit at the dinner table to eat an entire meal. It was ok in the highchair since he was strapped in like a [NASCAR](http://www.nascar.com/) driver. But we figured it was time to let him try being a big boy. He starts out just fine. He goes and sits in a chair and begins to eat. But after a few bites, he wants to continue to explore. He comes back periodically to get another bite of food, and continue the exploring. I find this a bit annoying.

Tomorrow, the booster seat comes out, hopefully this might help the situation. We'll see. At least there won't be any problems with the newborn sitting in the highchair since Adán has given up on it.

PS this all started before the birth of Marco, so I know it isn't jealousy.
