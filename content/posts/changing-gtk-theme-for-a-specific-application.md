You can run a specific GTK theme for a specific application, and it's good to test when a theme doesn't seem to load right.

`GTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.themes/Darkilouche/gtk-2.0/gtkrc f-spot`

I've been into developing my own gtk themes lately. To test them I like to use 'The Widget Factory'. http://www.stellingwerff.com/?page\_id=10 you@foo> twf
