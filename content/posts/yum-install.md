I swear I learn something new everyday. :) I reinstalled [Fedora Core 6](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/) on my workstation today, and went to reinstall [mugshot](http://mugshot.org/main). I downloaded the mugshot client, and attempted to install it: `sudo rpm -Uvh mugshot-1.1.40-1.fc6.x86_64.rpm` But it failed missing some dependencies: `error: Failed dependencies: libloudmouth-1.so.0()(64bit) is needed by mugshot-1.1.40-1.fc6.x86_64 loudmouth >= 1.0.3-3 is needed by mugshot-1.1.40-1.fc6.x86_64` I quickly griped that I wish there was a yum repo with mugshot in it. !@#$%^ Then the light went on in my feable brain. I wonder if `yum install path/to/rpm` will work? Only one way to find out. `yum install ~/downloads/mugshot-1.1.40-1.fc6.x86_64.rpm` WOO HOO, I worked. Yum properly processed the dependencies and sucked them down from the my currently subscribed yum repos.```
