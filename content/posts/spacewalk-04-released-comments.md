Congratulations with the new release. It's great to see you guys are making solid progress. I hope PostgreSQL support is on track as that is probably the single most important feature for me. (basically not having to buy/run Oracle that is). Thanks and keep up the great work!

I have this problem in my head that whenever I hear "spacewalk" I pronounce it like "sppppppaaaaaace ghoooooooost". Anyone else do this? (And not thinking of the new Cartoon Network stuff, I'm talking about old school USA Cartoon Express. Speaking of which, can we make a 'snorks' project? I can probably find an acronym)
