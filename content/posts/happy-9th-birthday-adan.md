Today Adan celebrated his 9th birthday. We hung out this morning building his new Clone Wars LEGO set, then had Sonic for lunch. In the late afternoon we had a chance to go roller skating (my first time on roller skates), then had dinner @ [Carrabbas](http://www.carrabbas.com/). It was definitely a good day (at least for me) :)
