While visiting Maryland for work, Liz & I took advantage of having family nearby. So we put the kids to bed, and had my parents watch them while we went to the movies for the first time in a long time. We had slim pickings though, so we settled on ["After the Sunset"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367479/) with Salma Hayek & Pierce Brosnan. It was a very good movie, better than we both thought it would be.
