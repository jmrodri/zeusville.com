It was time for a new pair of sneakers. I've always been a Nike fan, but this time I wanted to look for a pair of sneakers made in the USA. It is EXTREMELY difficult nigh impossible to find a pair made in the USA. Turns out the only company I could find that made shoes here was [New Balance](http://www.newbalance.com/USA/40015,default,sc.html#?prefn1=genderAndAgeGroupCombo&prefv1=Men), even then it is only a few of them. I ended up getting the [990v3 in Navy](http://www.newbalance.com/New-Balance-990v3/M990,default,pd.html?dwvar_M990_color=Navy_with_Grey_and_White&start=2&cgid=40015&prefn1=genderAndAgeGroupCombo&prefv1=Men)

It's sort of a shame that we don't have more things made in the USA, but I believe we are willing to pay the prices that made in the USA would cost. I wish it were easier to find made in the USA products though.
