Here's a tip on how to add transparency to your image in [gimp](http://www.gimp.org/ "gimp").

*   open the image, you want to work on
*   adding alpha channel (transparent layer) by CLICKING menu > LAYER > TRANSPARENCY > ADD ALPHA CHANNEL
*   select the fuzzy selector - and with it, click & select the area you want to remove
*   click & select the area you want to remove
*   now let's clear the area, by CLICKING menu EDIT > CLEAR (CTRL + K)
*   now your image has transparent background and is possible to save in a transparent capable format, like GIF or PNG
