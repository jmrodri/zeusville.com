I have run iTunes in vmware. I was able to access the music store, access my account and play songs. The only problem is that I never configured my virtual machine for audio support (it normally just runs sql server) so I didn't verify I could actually hear the songs on the linux side. I assume that if you load the right audio drivers in the virtual machine, it will work fine.
