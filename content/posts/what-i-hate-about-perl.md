I hate the```
return something unless condition.
```This hurts my brain since I read from left to right I think return? What about the rest of the function? Oh it's unless. I prefer:```
if (condition)
	return something;

```Also, the lack of types annoys me. I often wonder, "what am I looking at again? oh an int, no wait it's a string, hmm, actually it's all of the above, ARGH!"

I hate the grep function in perl. That's just evil.

There is much much more, but that's it for now.
