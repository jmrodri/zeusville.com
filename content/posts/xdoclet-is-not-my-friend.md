after 3 days of fighting xdoclet trying to get it to just run my simple template. I finally beat it into submission. Actually it beat me but I figured it out.

Unlike all the other ant tasks that works with a fileset definition used in all our other targets, the xdoclet one expects fileset to behave differently. ARGH!
