[sm-photo-tool](http://github.com/jmrodri/sm-photo-tool/) had a problem where it would no longer upload pictures to your [smugmug.com](http://smugmug.com) account, a bug of this magnitude pretty much renders a photo uploader useless :) I fixed the upload issue and at the same time switched it from using a HTTP POST with multipart encoded data to HTTP PUT. Uploads are now FASTER!
