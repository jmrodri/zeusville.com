**I DID IT! I DID IT!** I got my iPod and Fedora Core 2 talking to each other. It was an uphill battle. Apparently, FC2 was shipped with firewire turned off:

> Fedora Core 2 ships with a kernel that's quite close to 2.6.6 and that, as such, has seriously broken Firewire modules, so they were disabled to avoid the problems described in section 0.1. [link](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/%7Eoliva/snapshots/FC2-firewire/0README)

Here's what I did to get the iPod to work with FC2.

### Hardware

Belkin 3-port FireWire PCI card Model: [F5U503](http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&Section_Id=1969&pcount=&Product_Id=149022) Apple [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/index.html) 20GB ![](http://jroller.com/resources/jmrodri/ipod.jpg)

### Configuration

Edited my /etc/modprobe.conf:```
alias ieee1394-controller ohci1394
alias scsi\_hostadapter1 sbp2
```\*NOTE: scsi\_hostadapter1 was added since I already have an LSI Logic scsi adapter. Kuzdu added the following to /etc/fstab:```
/dev/sdc2  /mnt/ipod  auto  noauto,owner,kudzu 0 0
```

### Log messages

If you connect your iPod after Linux has booted you might see the following errors in /var/log/messages file:```
ieee1394.agent\[3185\]: ... no drivers for IEEE1394 product 0x/0x/0x
```Googling for the above error yielded an article stating the following (see resources below):

> I haven't really sorted out the problem but I have noticed that is the ipod is picked up and mounted if the ipod is plugged in when the machine is booted.

Connect your iPod, reboot into Linux and kudzu should kick in asking if you want to configure new device called "iPo". Click on configure. Then in your /var/log/messages file should be the following (sdc might be sda if you don't have any other SCSI devices):```
kernel: scsi2 : SCSI emulation for IEEE-1394 SBP-2 Devices
kernel: ieee1394: sbp2: Logged into SBP-2 device
kernel:  Vendor: Apple     Model: iPod Rev: 1.51
kernel:  Type:   Direct-Access         ANSI SCSI revision: 02
```

### On the filesystem

Kudzu should've created /mnt/ipod for you, if not create it. Then mount /mnt/ipod. Doing an ls -l /mnt/ipod yields four directories: Calendars, Contacts, iPod\_Control, and Notes. Your music is located in a series of directories fXX where XX is a 2 digit number, on my iPod it's 00 - 49. Those fXX directories are located in /mnt/ipod/iPod\_Control/Music. ![](http://fedora.redhat.com/images/header-fedora_logo.png) Most of the above was trial and error with many reboots in between. [FC3](http://fedora.redhat.com/participate/schedule/) should be out next week and it should have the FireWire built in to the kernel already during installation.
