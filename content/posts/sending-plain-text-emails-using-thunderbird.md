Personally, I dislike HTML email. I think email should be text only and want to use [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) to send out plain text emails. Out of the box, Thunderbird is setup to send HTML formatted emails.

Start Thunderbird  
Click Tools -> Account Settings  
Click on Composition & Addressing  
Uncheck "Compose messages in HTML format".  
Click OK

Now click Tools->Options  
Click Composition  
Change "Forward messages:" to "Inline"  
Click OK.

That should take care of it. Now you can send out plain text emails.
