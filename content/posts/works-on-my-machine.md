At my last job we used to joke we should develop our software on the box we would ship to customers since we constantly had "works on my machine" issues. Unfortunately, I think it happens in almost every software shop, where things seem to work better on the developers machine.

Jeff Atwood (no relation to the fictional character [Ryan Atwood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Atwood) from [The O.C.](http://www.fox.com/oc/)) has an interesting article on his [codinghorror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000818.html) blog.

LOL! Seems that continuous integration with your favorite server (Continuum, TeamCity, etc.) is the solution to the "works on my machine" problem ;-)
