my little boy used to watch his big brother play a game on the Nintendo where there was a character called Captain Falcon, whose signature move was the "Falcon Punch" accompanied by an eponymous yell... needless to say at MANY a playground he used to gleefully exclaim "F\*\*cken Punch" to anyone and everyone...

When my son was learning to speak the work "truck" came out as f\*\*k. My wife was driving around town with him when he saw a dump truck. He excitedly yelled "dum f\*\*k" over and over. My wife is still not sure how she stayed on the road while she laughed uncontrollably.
