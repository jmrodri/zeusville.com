Erik does an amazing job with his Tapestry presentation (I've never seen it, because if we're at the same conference, I do mine). However, with all that detail you might have missed that in Tapestry, components may have templates and those templates integrate with the containing page seamlessly. Thus, common layout and navigation moves into a reusable component. Such components are just as easy to create as pages ... HTML template + a little XML + maybe a short Java class. Unlike, Tiles, the Tapestry components can contain other Tapestry components inlcuding links and forms. Thus a component can have behavior in the context of a page, but seperate from the page itself. This is very powerful, easy and natural.
