Frustrating drive to work this morning? Try Boston traffic

Triangle traffic is bad but by no means as bad as other major cities like Washington, DC or Boston. The rush hour here in NC is usually over by 9:30am. Whereas in DC, I remember it being backed up at 10:30am.

Hmmm... I'm all for it. The revenue increase from "illegal lane change" tickets would be tremendous!
