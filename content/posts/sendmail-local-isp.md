I've always had my machines attempt to send me email at my isp address but they always got bounced back. So I finally set out to determine how to get sendmail to use my ISPs smtp server to send out email. And it turns out be a trivial task, but one I will document here for others to use:

You must be root to do this and stop sendmail:

```
su
/sbin/service sendmail stop

```Always backup your configuration files otherwise, don't come crying to me when your sendmail.cf is 0 bytes.```
cd /etc/mail
cp sendmail.cf sendmail\_cf.bak
cp sendmail.mc sendmail\_mc.bak

```Edit sendmail.mc (uncomment or add)```
define(\`SMART\_HOST',\`smtp.your.isp.com')

```Ensure you have sendmail-cf installed, otherwise install it.```
rpm -q sendmail-cf
yum -y install sendmail-cf

```Now rebuild sendmail.cf and restart sendmail.```
m4 sendmail.mc > sendmail.cf
/sbin/service sendmail start

```
