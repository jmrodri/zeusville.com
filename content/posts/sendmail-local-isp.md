I've always had my machines attempt to send me email at my isp address but they always got bounced back.

So I finally set out to determine how to get sendmail to use my ISPs smtp server to send out email. And it turns out be a trivial task, but one I will document here for others to use:

You must be root to do this and stop sendmail:

```


su

/sbin/service sendmail stop

Always backup your configuration files otherwise, don't come crying to me when your sendmail.cf is 0 bytes.

```


cd /etc/mail

cp sendmail.cf sendmail\_cf.bak

cp sendmail.mc sendmail\_mc.bak

Edit sendmail.mc (uncomment or add)

```


define(\`SMART\_HOST',\`smtp.your.isp.com')

Ensure you have sendmail-cf installed, otherwise install it.

```


rpm -q sendmail-cf

yum -y install sendmail-cf

Now rebuild sendmail.cf and restart sendmail.

```


m4 sendmail.mc > sendmail.cf

/sbin/service sendmail start


```
```
```
```
```

At the risk of getting flamed for going beyond the command line - I can thoroughly recommend webmin (http://www.webmin.com) - it's interface for sendmail configuration is really quite good.

No one should ever get flamed for not using the command line. I'd be perfectly happy if every admin task was available through a UI in Linux. And I think it would make it even more popular for the home user.

Thanks for this. Short & to the point.
