I watched American Idol Rejects... William Hung rocked the house! Have you seen his website? http://www.williamhung.net :-)

It's good to know that Jesus watches Average Joe 2...I don't feel so bad now. Anyhow, I totally agree. It does appear though that Larissa and Gil are still in a relationship even though the program didn't portray it as such. At least this is what they said on the news this morning.
