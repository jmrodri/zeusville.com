Here's how I got my tmux windows to be named 'short hostname:working directory'. Create a bash function in your `$HOME/.bashrc`.```
settitle ()
{
    # only run this in tmux
    case "$TERM" in
        screen\*)
            # get hostname without FQDN
            H=\`hostname -s\`
            # get current directory without the full path
            D=\`basename $PWD\`
            # set title of tmux/screen window
            printf "33k$H:$D33\\\\"
            ;;
    esac
}

```Then call `settitle` from your `PS1` prompt variable:```
PS1="...(settitle)\\$ "

```Here is my current prompt:```
PS1="\[\\u@\\h \\W\\$(git branch 2> /dev/null | grep -e '\\\* ' | sed 's/^..\\(.\*\\)/{\\1}/')\]\\$(settitle)\\$ " 

```
