This morning, Grandpop, Grandma, the kids & I went strawberry picking at [Vollmer Farm](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vollmerfarm.com%2F&ei=VhYdSOKcMIm6zQTvwaC4Aw&usg=AFQjCNHD27ynRHwOxIsCHUKUbDELAHLEPQ&sig2=GqNFTqorACDYKtjV22Tozw) in Bunn, NC. We came home with 3 buckets full. The berries are plump, red and sweet!

This afternoon, Grandpop Frank & I took the boys to see [Iron Man](http://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=B6K29gxUdSIbfBIyGyASQ3b2LBbDEh1egnaiRBvnWhQbw9RIIABABGAEgtlQ4AVDT0cO4______8BYMn-sYqkpMQRyAEBgAIByALQ-Z8G2QNki9qKbIfYOg&ggladgrp=2310830483274276437&gglcreat=3810997525902377072&sig=AGiWqtxXMeijlyFNvyG37t0OpkqZOpLk1w&q=http://www.ironmanmovie.com/). Usually I don't see movies the weekend they have been released, but I promised the boys I'd take them today.  The movie was AWESOME! Adan & Marco loved it, as did I.

Then finally this evening, I drove the Trans Am to it's [new owner](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/trans-am-sold-officially-this-time/) at RDU.
