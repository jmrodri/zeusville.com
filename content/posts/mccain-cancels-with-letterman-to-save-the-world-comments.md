Not only does he want to postpone the Presidential debate, but he wants to postpone the VP debate as well. http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/09/mccain-camp-let.html Combine that with the fact that he didn't leave his campaign in Palin's hands, as Letterman pointed out, and it starts to seem like he might not have a lot of faith in Palin's capabilities as VP.
