I got it working fine on the desktop, but still need to work out a couple of things on my Dell x300 laptop. One, I couldn't get acpi working - Tried to upgrade to 2.6 Kernel but no luck. And I still dont know if I can get wireless networking to work with the Centrino chips. Any ideas?

Kashif, You may want to download the latest acpi patch from http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi. I used it on my Sony Vaio using Gentoo. I complied my own kernel and it works great!
