Today we released [Spacewalk](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/WikiStart) 0.4! It was an amazing release, I'm proud of the teams accomplishments with this release. We continue to move towards integrating open source projects as well as trying to get ourselves working on Fedora. Here are a few of what you will find in Spacewalk 0.4.

**Features & Enhancements**

*   integration with [Cobbler](https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/) and [Koan](http://git.fedoraproject.org/git/koan)

*   introduction Organization Trusts and Channel sharing, known internally as Multi-Org II: The Sequel.

*   [multi-arch enhancement](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/MultiArchEnhancements) to better work with multi-arch packages on 64-bit systems.

*   a new set of [APIs](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/ApiAdditions), including the following namespaces:
    
    *   channel.access.\*
    
    *   channel.org.\*
    
    *   package.\*
    

*   [SELinux](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/Features/SELinux) support added

*   added the ability to search documentation, in Spacewalk we include a search index of the online docs.

*   updated the help page to include api docs and docs search

*   more perl to java migrations

*   satellite-httpd was removed in favor of using the standard httpd

*   upgrades from 0.3 -> 0.4 available as well: [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/HowToUpgrade](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/HowToUpgrade)

**Bugs fixed**

An outstanding **118**! total bugs fixed since 0.3 - [http://tinyurl.com/7oytud](http://tinyurl.com/7oytud)

**Known issues**

*   in order to take full advantage of the multi-arch feature, you'll need:
    
    *   updated client packages
    
    *   recreate the stored profiles
    

*   bad news is that Spacewalk running on Fedora is not yet available. The good news is that we have started building packages to work with Fedora 10. :)

*   [480233](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=480233) - deleting stored profiles causes ISE

*   [479640](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=479640) - do not conflict with specspo. Work around is to rpm -e specspo.

**Community**

Congratulations with the new release. It's great to see you guys are making solid progress. I hope PostgreSQL support is on track as that is probably the single most important feature for me. (basically not having to buy/run Oracle that is). Thanks and keep up the great work!

I have this problem in my head that whenever I hear "spacewalk" I pronounce it like "sppppppaaaaaace ghoooooooost". Anyone else do this? (And not thinking of the new Cartoon Network stuff, I'm talking about old school USA Cartoon Express. Speaking of which, can we make a 'snorks' project? I can probably find an acronym)
