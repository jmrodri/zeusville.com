Our old [Hoover](http://www.dyson.com/tech/dysoncyclone/default.asp?sinavtype=inpage) vacuum was 10 years old and was grunting. The bags were nasty and made the house smell like dirty dog. With the kids and Liz' allergies, we really needed something better.

We've always wanted a [Dyson](http://www.dyson.com) vacuum cleaner because of the HEPA feature and the bagless operation. [Dyson](http://www.dyson.com) is to vacuums as [Apple](http://www.apple.com) is to computers.

Today I went to [Target](http://www.target.com) to buy our new [Dyson DC07](http://www.dyson.com/range/access_frame.asp?model=DC07-SY-HEPA) All Floors model. The box was designed with the consumer in mind, it stated to open two flaps on either side, then lift the top side. No need to pull those darn staples found on other appliance boxes, or that industrial glue requiring the box to be cut instead of pulled apart.

After vacuuming an area with our old Hoover, I vacuumed it again with the [Dyson](http://www.dyson.com). It's amazing how much more crap the [Dyson](http://www.dyson.com) would suck up. My favorite part is the touchless container dumping. You detach the container, and pull a trigger. The bottom opens up allowing you to dump the dust and dirt into the trashcan without having to touch it.
