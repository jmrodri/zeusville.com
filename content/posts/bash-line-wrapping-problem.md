I noticed I was having a line wrapping issue with my bash prompt which really got annoying. It's been at least a month and I finally decided to find a fix for it. ![wrapping problem](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/wrap.png) My prompt in .bashrc is `PS1="[\u@\e[0;31m\h\e[1;39m \W]: "` According to [this post](http://forums.macosxhints.com/archive/index.php/t-17068.html) I need to wrap the escape codes with `\[`. So I changed my prompt to the following and all seems well: `PS1="[\u@\[\e[0;31m\]\h\[\e[1;39m\] \W]: "` ![wrapped fix](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/wrapfix.png)
