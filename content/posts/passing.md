I'm saddened that Father John Parish has passed away Sunday night. I saw a resurgence at [Saint Catherine of Siena in Wake Forest](http://www.stcathsiena.org/). It was fun going to church again. He made everyone feel welcome with is warm introductions, and was great at explaining the day's readings in his [homily](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homily) which most priests (at leasts the ones I've heard) are really bad at. I pray that he will find peace and that he will be reunited with his mom who passed a few months ago.
