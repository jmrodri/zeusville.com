Not sure what it was but I felt like I had things to do today :)  I re-caulked the kitchen sink (twice), amazing what masking tape can do to make the job a lot easier. I took a trip to [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com) to buy a few things for my next project:

*   50 feet of indoor/outdoor cat 5e cable
*   two cat 5e jacks \[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="108" caption="cat 5e jack"\][![cat 5e jack](http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/300/72/72730db8-f302-4e9f-bd01-b1352444c156_300.jpg "cat 5e jack")](http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&langId=-1&catalogId=10053&productId=100020255&N=10000003+90282)\[/caption\]
*   two f-connectors \[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="108" caption="f-connector"\][![f-connector](http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/300/2e/2eb91223-1312-42a4-a107-644d16321577_300.jpg "f-connector")](http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&langId=-1&catalogId=10053&productId=100014247&N=10000003+90282)\[/caption\]
*   two 4 port wall plates \[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="180" caption="wallplate"\][![wallplate](http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/300/f5/f530cebc-e6a3-48fd-a4fb-3df05d01b7a8_300.jpg "wallplate")](http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&langId=-1&catalogId=10053&productId=100092855&N=10000003+90282)\[/caption\]

I started the project, running ethernet to the living room where the TV  and [Playstation 3](http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Systems/80gb.html) (PS3) are.  I got tired of the lag while streaming content to the PS3.  I installed a new 4 port jack in the bedroom where the cable comes into the house, it has a coax and an ethernet port, and two empty spots for 'upgrading later'. I bought 50 feet of outdoor cat 5 cable and scoped out the path I plan to run it along. I also replaced the Linksys [BEFSR41](http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-EtherFast-Router-4-Port-BEFSR41/dp/B00004SB92) router (being used as a switch) with a [D-Link DGS-2208](http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=495) 8 port gigabit switch. The hard part is still left to do, the actual running  of the cable, crawling around in the dirty crawl space :) and run it up next to the TV. And finally, I booked the beach house for our summer vacation this year.
