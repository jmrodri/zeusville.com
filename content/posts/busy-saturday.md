Not sure what it was but I felt like I had things to do today :)  I re-caulked the kitchen sink (twice), amazing what masking tape can do to make the job a lot easier.

I took a trip to [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com) to buy a few things for my next project:

*   50 feet of indoor/outdoor cat 5e cable

*   two cat 5e jacks

*   two f-connectors

*   two 4 port wall plates

I started the project, running ethernet to the living room where the TV  and [Playstation 3](http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Systems/80gb.html) (PS3) are.  I got tired of the lag while streaming content to the PS3.  I installed a new 4 port jack in the bedroom where the cable comes into the house, it has a coax and an ethernet port, and two empty spots for 'upgrading later'. I bought 50 feet of outdoor cat 5 cable and scoped out the path I plan to run it along. I also replaced the Linksys [BEFSR41](http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-EtherFast-Router-4-Port-BEFSR41/dp/B00004SB92) router (being used as a switch) with a [D-Link DGS-2208](http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=495) 8 port gigabit switch. The hard part is still left to do, the actual running  of the cable, crawling around in the dirty crawl space :) and run it up next to the TV.

And finally, I booked the beach house for our summer vacation this year.

Sounds fun. Got the same problem with lag on my PS3 while streaming too, although I noticed a drastic improvement after I switched the wireless off channel 6 and 7. No cable run yet but I'll might eventually.
