It would really depend on your choice.. I guess there are lots of things that needs to be considered.. Car buying is really a process - you have to think it over and over again before making a decision. I can relate with your situation. Well I had this car for almost 10 years now - lots of parts had been replaced (like [toyota suspension bushing](http://www.autotoyparts.com/toyota-suspension-bushings/ "toyota suspension bushing"),fuel pump, radiator,etc) and I've been thinking of buying a newer car. The only problem I have is that my budget is not enough to buy one. \*sighs\* I think I had to save up first and use my car for the meantime and hope that there would be no problems. finger crossed

You have front-wheel drive as cons? I used to have rear-wheel drive cars, but now have second front-wheel car and it is much better to drive.

Dude, Just go out and buy a car. I wouldn't get one of the cop cars, but that's just me. If you go down that route.... http://www.cadillac.com/cadillacjsp/model/gallery.jsp?model=dts&year=2007 Fwiw, I like my little protege (predecessor to the mazda3) just fine.
