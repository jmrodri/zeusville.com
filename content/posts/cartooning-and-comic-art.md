Today I registered to take "Cartooning and Comic Art" at [Wake Technical Community College](http://www.waketech.edu/). Classes begin on Monday August 27th. Here are the [supplies](http://evening.waketech.edu/supplies/cartooningcomicart.php) I need to get (I'm posting it here mostly for my reference later):

*   Sketchbook
*   Graphite Pencil set including 4H-6B pencils
*   Strathmore Bristol Pad (smooth)
*   Micron Pen set including sizes: 005-8
*   Colors of your choosing (colored pencil, ink, watercolor, acrylic)_\* if you bring paint be sure to bring proper cleaning materials!_

Should be an interesting class.
