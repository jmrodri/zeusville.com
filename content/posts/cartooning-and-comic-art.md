Today I registered to take "Cartooning and Comic Art" at
[Wake Technical Community College](http://www.waketech.edu/). Classes begin on
Monday August 27th.

Here are the [supplies](http://evening.waketech.edu/supplies/cartooningcomicart.php)
I need to get (I'm posting it here mostly for my reference later):

* Sketchbook
* Graphite Pencil set including 4H-6B pencils
* Strathmore Bristol Pad (smooth)
* Micron Pen set including sizes: 005-8
* Colors of your choosing (colored pencil, ink, watercolor, acrylic)
  _\* if you bring paint be sure to bring proper cleaning materials!_

Should be an interesting class.

How cool! I am jealous - I have always wanted to take an art class. Of course,
if you have seen anything I have ever created, you will agree it would have to
involve the word 'abstract'. I hope you'll post some of your masterpieces!
