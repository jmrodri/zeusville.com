I've about had it with the Time Warner DVR. They recently updated the software to some crappy shit called Mystro. The DVR hasn't been the same since the upgrade. Random crashes, for example during the Olympics and during the Democratic National Convention! Today the guide wouldn't come up and I rebooted it 3 times and now it thinks I don't have any shows to record. This is crap.

So now I want a [TiVo](http://www.tivo.com) DVR, I'm thinking of getting the HD DVR even though I don't have an HDTV. The HD DVR can record standard and HD content and works with any TV. It also helps when I do get an HDTV, I won't have to buy a new TiVo.

I've contacted Time Warner to find out how much their CableCARD is going to cost and how much I'll save in returning the DVR and cablebox. I wish I could just throw it at them.

Alternatively, I could build my own Myth TV, but I don't want to have to be a sysadmin for the TV box too. So realistically that's out.
