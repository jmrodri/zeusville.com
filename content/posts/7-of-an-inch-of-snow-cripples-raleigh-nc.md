We had a dusting of snow which turned to ice and caused massive gridlock. I left work at 3pm and arrived at home at 11:50pm. I spent 3 hours at my old company visiting stranded friends. It was a horrible evening. Time for some needed rest and relaxation. WRAL story:Â [http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1090769/](http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1090769/)
