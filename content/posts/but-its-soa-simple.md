This cracks me up: [OASIS forms six committees to simplify SOA](http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/08/09/sca-oasis_1.html). I thought it was SOA simple.

Honestly, I think SOA as it is implemented today is overly complex. The idea of services and messaging are great, but the implementation with SOAP is less than spectacular. I think if they want to simplify SOA, get rid of SOAP use something something simple like [JSON-RPC](http://json-rpc.org/).
