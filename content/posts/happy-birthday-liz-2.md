Today is Liz' birthday. I'm working from home today to help her out on this wonderful day. We had a busy morning already. Adan and Marco woke us up at 6:19am to give Liz her birthday cards and presents. Then we let her sleep in afterwards (until 9am actually). The boys helped me bake a carrot cake. Adan poured in the water, I did the eggs, and Marco put in the oil. Both Marco and Adan got a chance to use the mixer, and to lick the blades when we were done mixing :) That's the best part in my opinion. I proceeded to get the boys ready for school, pulled the cake out of the oven to cool, then took Adan and Marco to school. I then picked up some [hotcakes and sausage](http://www.mcdonalds.com/usa/eat/features/breakfast.html) from [McDonald's](http://www.mcdonalds.com/) for breakfast. Later today, we plan on going bowling at [Buffaloe Lanes](http://www.buffaloelanes.com/north/index.htm) in Raleigh. Then dinner at [Ted's Montana Grill](http://www.tedsmontanagrill.com/).
