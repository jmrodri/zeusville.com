This afternoon around 4pm, we went to meet Ad√°n pre-school class and teachers. I can't believe he's going to be three years old. It was just yesterday he was sleeping on my chest while we napped on the couch. Time flies.

We've been worrying whether he'd be ok in pre-school, especially since he's not fully potty trained, and rarely if ever is away from mommy or me. But after today, we think he'll do just fine. I think we're the ones that will have a hard time.
