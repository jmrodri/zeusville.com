I did some car work this weekend. The poor Trans Am isn't doing very well, among the broken items are oil leak, worn tires, driver door panel has been removed, front passenger fender has a crack in it, the paint is dull, and it leaks coolant.

On Friday, a hose burst on the way up the parking lot. I didn't think it would make it home but I managed :) So I cut the hose just below the crack and reinstalled it. It seems to have held up nicely.

Here are some pics:
