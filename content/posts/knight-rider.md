I DVR'd the NBC television movie ["Knight Rider"](http://www.knightridermovie.com/). I didn't have very high expectations because they went with a freakin' [MUSTANG](http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2007/11/shelby-gt500-kr-to-star-in-new-knight.html) :( for KITT. But I have to say that's one bad @$$ Mustang. Makes me want to trade in the Trans Am for a new Mustang :). ![](http://www.knightridermovie.com/images/index_07.gif)
