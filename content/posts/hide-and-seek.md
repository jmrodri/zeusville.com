I've forgotten how fun hide and seek can be to play. Ad√°n counted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 20. Then he proceeded to seek. I hid on the steps, in the powder room, in the kitchen, crouched near the counter, in plain site next to a few doors, each time I was found a shreiking laugh and giggle. It was a classic moment that required pulling out the video camera to capture his face as he giggled when he found "Dada".
