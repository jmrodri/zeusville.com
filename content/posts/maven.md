OMG, you said it...I've been using Maven under duress for the past 1.5 years and I've probably gotten to be the best person to figure out why it does stupid stuff. Friends don't let friends use maven. It's a fascist program. You VILL download all zee pakaches, oder you vill haff no built, ja? Apologies to all the Hitler fans, you nuts you!
