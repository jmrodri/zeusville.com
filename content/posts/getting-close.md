We're getting very close to releasing zmugfs 0.1, the read-only release. As you may recall on Monday I got zmugfs to [show imgdata](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/10/08/zmugfs-shows-image-data/) in nautilus. [](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/zmugfs_imgdata.png "img data")[![img data](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/zmugfs_imgdata.thumbnail.png)](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/zmugfs_imgdata.png "img data") But I could only get it to work if I used the thumbnail sized imgdata. In the read() method I was logging into smugmug, reading the thumbnail imgdata, logging out of smugmug, getting the imgdata via http GET, and returning. Well, this is crazy because read gets called multiple times with different offsets. So I ended up implementing the open() and release() methods. In the open, I get the imgdata (original size) via the smugmug api and store the imgdata in an image cache (an in memory dictionary). In the read method, it now respects the offset and size attributes by reading from the image cache. Then in the release method, I delete the entry from the image cache. I know not much of a cache. :) But it solved my problem. I'm putting the cache work off a bit, not sure how to approach that yet. Next thing I wanted to try all of the command line utils (at least the ones I've used before) to see how they react to zmugfs. I was pleasantly surprised with the result.

From a readonly perspective, it is looking great. What's left before a release you ask? Just a few things.

*   packaging
    *   write spec file
    *   figure out setup.py
*   design a logo
*   move code to zmugtools for branding purposes
*   work out image cache

That's it, once I finish those things zmugfs 0.1 will be released out into the wild! I'm really excited as this is my first ever open source project. I've submitted patches to a few things, but never anything this extensive.
