I have been using the [StreamSicle](http://streamsicle.com) project with great joy for the same type of functionality.

It is a Java web application and songs is selected via browser interface.

Works very nicely and is open source so you can make it fit your needs.

I just checked and the development seems to be at a halt for the last year or so, but the product as is working with no problems for me.

Looks good. I'm downloading it now. Since I'm a Java developer, I'd love to have something to tweak. Thanks for the comment.

I know you're a Java guy but if you ever want to dabble in Apache/mod\_perl then take a peek at [Apache::MP3](http://search.cpan.org/~lds/Apache-MP3-3.05/MP3.pm).
