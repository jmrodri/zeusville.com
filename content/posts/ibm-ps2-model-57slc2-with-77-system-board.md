My first computer was a [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) where I learned to write POKE and SPRITE from the manual. But it would still be a few years before I got into computers.

In my freshman year in [college](http://www.umd.edu/), I convinced my parents to buy me an IBM PS/2 [Model 30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_System/2#Models). It was a 286 with 1MB ram, 20GB hard drive, and 3 ISA slots. I used that for a couple years, then gave upgraded it with a 386SX/NOW upgrade chip and maxed its memory so my brother could use it in [college](http://www.vt.edu/).

My junior year of [college](http://www.umd.edu/), I had saved up enough to buy the IBM PS/2 I had lusted for, a [Model 57SLC2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_System/2#Models). This machine had kicked ass:

*   8MB RAM

*   486SLC/2 50MHz CPU

*   212MB SCSI drive

*   2.88MB floppy

*   [Microchannel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroChannel) bus (no fighting with interrupts)

The PS/2 came pre-installed with [OS/2 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_OS/2). I later installed [OS/2 Warp 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_OS/2#The_.22Warp.22_years), then finally installed [Red Hat Linux 6.1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux) with mca enabled in the kernel.

About 4 years ago, I upgraded the Model 57SLC2 with a system board of a [Model 77i](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_System/2#Models). This boosted me to:

*   486DX4 100MHz CPU

*   IDE on board

*   S3 onboard video

How about some pictures of this baby (before it saw it's demise in the Wake County recycling dump)?
