Well, it has been three weeks since I put my Trans Am in the shop. And the oil cooler was busted which took an entire week to get that part (the last one needed to finish the repairs). We're looking at getting it either this afternoon or tomorrow. I'm not holding my breath though. I'm betting Friday.

Off to lunch.
