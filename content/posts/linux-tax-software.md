I wish vendors like [TaxCut](http://www.taxcut.com/) and [TurboTax](http://www.turbotax.com/) would develop Linux versions of their tax software. I'm tired of having to use Windows just to do my taxes. I still don't think [WINE](http://www.winehq.com) is capable enough to run all of my Windows programs. It works for a majority but not ALL. So if I can't run all my programs, then I need to keep Windows around for something.
