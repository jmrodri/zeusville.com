I wish vendors like [TaxCut](http://www.taxcut.com/) and [TurboTax](http://www.turbotax.com/) would develop Linux versions of their tax software. I'm tired of having to use Windows just to do my taxes. I still don't think [WINE](http://www.winehq.com) is capable enough to run all of my Windows programs. It works for a majority but not ALL. So if I can't run all my programs, then I need to keep Windows around for something.

Web versions exist. I used web version of TurboTax last year -- worked great.

I second the Web versions. I always use the web versions through my bank. Plus, it keeps all my past data no matter what I do to my PC.

Personally, I don't trust the web version. I prefer native software. But I wouldn't be opposed to installing a web version on my machine. That would be interesting.

You know, the pen & paper method of doing taxes isn't too bad either.
