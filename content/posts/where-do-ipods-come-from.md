We bought Iliana an [iPod Shuffle](http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/), like her brothers she's a huge music fan. The iPod Shuffle is an awesome music device for kids, simple, small, and fashionable.

Today, Iliana said "it comes from Lowes Foods". Confused I said, "huh?" Iliana points at the apple logo on the back. Laughter ensues. So where do iPod's come from? [Lowes Foods](http://www.lowesfoods.com/).
