I haven't had coffee since I was 8 years old and tried my parents coffee, but today I tried some coffee again.  I put some dry creamer and some Splenda.  It was actually good.  Though I probably only had about 3 ounces.

I doubt I'll begin to drink coffee, don't care for warm drinks.  I'll stick with my Diet Cokes in the morning.

Hmm . . . coffee vs diet soda? No contest!! I LOVE my coffee, always have. I gave it up for a full year because it was really doing a number on my stomach. But, in the end I'm willing to live with the pain. You should try it iced - delicious and refreshing! :-)
