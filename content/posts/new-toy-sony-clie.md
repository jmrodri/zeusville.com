My new [Sony Clié TJ27](http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start;sid=TcXsfleTXv3sfRcgAUPmdRickFleD-SwlYc=?ProductSKU=PEGTJ27%2fUKIT1) arrived today. I bought it from my favorite online store [Newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=58-201-023&depa=0). Since I've switched to [Fedora Core 2](http://fedora.redhat.com) as my main OS, I will now attempt to get Clié to connect with Fedora via USB. At work, I'm using [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](http://www.redhat.com/software/rhel/) and will attempt to get the Clié to connect with it as well.
