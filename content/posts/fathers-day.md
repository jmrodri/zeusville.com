On Saturday, we went to the [Durham Bulls](http://www.durhambulls.com) game.
We had a great time despite the thunderstorm that caused a 45 minute rain
delay, and the fact that the Bulls were losing 8 to 1.

I had a great Father's Day. I cut the grass, finally after a week with no
mowing. I was about to apply for a farming permit to grow wheat. Adán and I
went to the store, he rode in the shopping cart at Kohl's. He had a good time.
For dinner, I grilled some chicken while Adán assisted on his little Home Depot
Toy Grill.

For Father's Day, I got the most beautiful gift, a framed poem called
["Footprints"](http://www.onceuponaname.com/wal.html) with both Marco's and
Adán's stamped footprints. It's awesome. Thanks Liz!
