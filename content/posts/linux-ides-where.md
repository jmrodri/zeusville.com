I think one of the things that has made Windows more popular for corporate users than Linux is the availability of good development tools. I'd like to see an IDE to develop GNOME applications. If one exists please let me know.

**Update:**I guess there are some. Take a look at [Anjuta](http://anjuta.org/)

I think you can use KDevelop to GNOME as well. Anjuta is a good one as well. Probably GOOGLE is your best friend in this case.
