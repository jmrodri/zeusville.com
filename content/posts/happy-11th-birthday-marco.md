We had a good day. Took Marco to the movies to see ["Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1698641/). Then went to Target to cash in his gift cards, then dinner at [Red Lobster](http://www.redlobster.com/). Ended the evening with an ice cream cake from [Cold Stone Creamery.](http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/) [![IMG_20140615_150200](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/14302398308_43111a5fb6_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jmrodri/14302398308 "IMG_20140615_150200 by Jesus Rodriguez, on Flickr")
