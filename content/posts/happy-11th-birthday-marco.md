We had a good day. Took Marco to the movies to see ["Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1698641/). Then went to Target to cash in his gift cards, then dinner at [Red Lobster](http://www.redlobster.com/). Ended the evening with an ice cream cake from [Cold Stone Creamery.](http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/)
