I was trying to figure out how to change the default size of my Gnome Terminal. [![](http://www.jroller.com/resources/jmrodri/gnome-terminal_thumb.png)](http://www.jroller.com/resources/jmrodri/gnome-terminal.png)There isn't any GUI to change this option (been spoiled by Windoze). After doing some [Google](http://www.google.com) searches I found the word I was looking for geometry. Then the ole memory kicked in and I remembered that you can pass in the size to any X Windows application. So I gave it a shot:```
gnome-terminal --geometry 80x60
```VIOLA! Got what I needed.

What about a quick 'man gnome-terminal' instead of Google search?

Smart ass comments aren't really required. This post was made in 2003. You can't spread the word of Linux by being a smart ass. Something more like "in the future try man to find out information about a given program" vs your snarky comment.
