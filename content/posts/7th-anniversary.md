Yesterday, Liz & I celebrated our 7th wedding anniversary. We didn't do much seeing as we have a 8 day old child. We did go to dinner at [Winston's Grille](http://www.winstonsgrille.com/), we had a good time considering we took all three kids. Iliana did the best out of the three.

I had the [London Broil](http://www.winstonsgrille.com/OurMenu-Entrees.asp) and the [Key Lime pie](http://www.winstonsgrille.com/OurMenu-Desserts.asp) for dessert. I love the service at Winston's and the food. Liz settled for the [Shrimp Rigatoni](http://www.winstonsgrille.com/OurMenu-Entrees.asp) as they didn't have anymore of the [French Dip sandwiches](http://www.winstonsgrille.com/OurMenu-Burgers.asp).

After I dropped the boys off at school this morning, I went to McDonald's to get us breakfast. We try to go at least once a month to breakfast, which changes now with the new baby. So McDonald's it was :)
