I got my weekly newegg.com email flyer today and saw they had a great 15% off sale on all hard drives. I thought it would be worth looking into. But I noticed that a $119 1.5TB hard drive came up to $109. Hrm that's not 15%, that's only 11.9% what gives.

I go re-read the ad to make sure it wasn't specific brands or types of hard drives, that's when I noticed the restrictions "maximum of $10". What in the world? maximum of $10? Why would they say 15% off then? Just make it a $10 coupon. UGH. This pains me a lot because I'm a HUGE fan of newegg.com, and hate to see such silly ads from them.
