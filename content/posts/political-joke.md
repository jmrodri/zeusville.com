Email I got from a friend.

> A popular bar had a new robotic bartender installed. A fellow came in for a drink and the robot asked him, 'What's your IQ?'
> 
> The man replied, '150.' So the robot proceeded to make conversation about Quantum physics, string theory, atomic chemistry, and so on.
> 
> The man listened intently and thought, 'This is really cool.'
> 
> The man decided to test the robot. He walked out the bar, turned around, and came back in for another drink. Again, the robot asked him, 'What's your IQ?'
> 
> The man responded, '100.' So the robot started talking about football, baseball, and so on.
> 
> The man thought to himself, 'Wow, this is amazing.'
> 
> The man went out and came back in a third time. As before, the robot asked him, 'What's your IQ?'
> 
> The man replied, '50.' The robot then said, 'So, you gonna vote for Bush again?'
