This year, we decided to spend 4th of July in Maryland (just outside of Washington, DC). We plan on cooking out and watching the fireworks from the back deck (I'll post pictures tomorrow).

Also, if you don't have young kids, I recommend at least once spending the 4th of July on the [Mall](http://www.nationalmall.org/) in [Washington, D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)C. Take a cooler, blanket, sunscreen, and patience. :) Spend the entire day drinking, sunning, and enjoying the music and festivities. At the end you'll be rewarded to an excellent fireworks display with accompanying music.
