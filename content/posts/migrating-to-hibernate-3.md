We seem to have had some good success with [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org) 2.1. Though I've been excited about migrating to Hibernate 3 in our next release. I'm beginning to plan our migration strategy, and some of the things we can refactor to take advantage of the new things in Hibernate 3.

And for those of you new to Hibernate, don't forget to check out [Hibernate in Action](http://www.manning.com/books/bauer) which was our guide through our Hibernate development. Now I need a Hibernate 3 book.
