For some reason the Lollipop OTA wouldn't install on my Nexus 4. It kept failing with the following error:```
Package expects build fingerprint of
google/occam/mako:4.4.4/KTU84P/1227136:user/release-keys or
google/occam/mako:5.0/LRX21T/1576899:user/release-keys: this device has
google/occam/mako:4.4.2/KOT49H/937116:user/release-keys.

E:Error in

```I tried a couple of times but no avail. The reports I read mentioned something might have changed for being root. I unlocked and rooted the Nexus 4 when I bought it, but I don't remember really doing anything that really should've messed anything up. But oh well. I even tried flashing the two recoveries that matched: KOT49H and KTU84P. That didn't help. So I downloaded the factory image and ran the flash-all.sh.```

```Phone has rebooted and re-downloading apps from Google. Next I'll restore my Helium backup hopefully that worked :)
