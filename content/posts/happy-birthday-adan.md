Adán turned 6 years old on Saturday, 9/29/07. I can not believe it has already been six years. He's looks so grown up, losing his babyish features. He's considerate and very caring of others. He is a perfectionist like his mother :) and artistic and a mathwiz like his father (that's me) :) Happy 6th Birthday, Adán!
