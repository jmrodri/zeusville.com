I installed Fedora 8 RC on Monday night. I chose to backup my homedir and do a fresh install of Fedora 8 instead of upgrading my Fedora Core 6 install. I went this route mostly because my Fedora Core 6 was an upgrade of Fedora Core 5 which was an upgrade of Fedora Core 5 Test 1,2,3 :) Figured it was time to get out any cruft that may have been lying around. The install went fairly well. I chose virtualization during install, then chose not to install Xen. But something I clicked on caused Xen to get installed anyway making it the default kernel at first boot. A quick edit of grub.conf fixed that. I then rsync'd my homedir back over and logged in. Some of the applets didn't start because I had forgotten to install them. Not a big deal,that was my fault not Fedora's. The only real problem I ran into was trying to turn on "Desktop Effects", with my copied over homedir, the window borders wouldn't show up when Desktop Effects was enabled. But if I logged in as another user with freshly generated configs it worked. So I threw away my configs and recreated my homedir and logged in to have GNOME create the basic entries, VIOLA! Desktop Effects worked (for about 40 minutes then a hard lockup of X) :( I should've figured as much as my previous attempts resulted in the same behavior: [try #1](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/03/06/desktop-effects-locks-up-my-box/) and [try #2](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/03/07/desktop-effects-locks-up-my-box-part-2/). Another little problem is with [NetworkManager](http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/) 0.7 and static ips. In FC6, [NetworkManager](http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/) worked GREAT with my static ip. But the one in Fedora 8 INSISTS on doing a dhcp request. I know I can do with out [NetworkManager](http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/) as I'm not using wireless, but I'm fond of the vpnc menu in [NetworkManager.](http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/) So far no show stopper problems. Fedora 8 has beautiful [artwork](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Artwork/F8Themes), a cool new [GNOME vnc client](http://www.gnome.org/projects/vinagre/), and [online desktop](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/FeatureOnlineDesktop). Fedora is like a fine wine, it gets better with age. Kudos to the Fedora members for a fine release.
