I was constantly missing [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) pings with [XChat](http://www.xchat.org/), so I found this wonderful plugin to popup a dialog with the message I was sent. Here's a screenshot. [![xchat dialog (uses zenity)](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/xchat.png)](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/xchat.png "xchat dialog (uses zenity)")
