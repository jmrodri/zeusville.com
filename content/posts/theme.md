I got a comment to my [recent post](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/iliana-becomes-a-fedora-user/) asking me what [theme](http://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2/) I was using. I figured I'd go ahead and post it here:

> Nice font and theme! What font is that? What dpi? What freetype version (with or without bytecode)? What theme do you use?

The theme I am using is a slightly modified version of [Darkilouche](http://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2/1285) as the application theme, and [Gilouche](http://art.gnome.org/themes/metacity/1286) as the Metacity theme. I changed the orange(#f57900) in Darkilouche to red (#e30800). I switched back to Darkilouche after having trouble with Firefox and [Neutronium](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Neutronium+Unity?content=59189). As far as the font goes, I'm also using the [Liberation](http://www.press.redhat.com/2007/05/09/liberation-fonts/) fonts with freetype 2.3.4-3.
