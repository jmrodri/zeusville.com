Sadly my talk on Integrating with [cobbler](https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/) was not chosen for FUDCon, not enough interest. You can get my slides from my fedorapeople page: [http://jmrodri.fedorapeople.org/cobbler-integration.pdf](http://jmrodri.fedorapeople.org/cobbler-integration.pdf)**(PDF)** I'll post a bit more about my talk in a later post.
