Sadly my talk on Integrating with [cobbler](https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/) was not chosen for FUDCon, not enough interest. You can get my slides from my fedorapeople page:

I'll post a bit more about my talk in a later post.

Nice title you have there! Good clean presentation. Others could learn from yours on what a presentation is :)
