Tomorrow is Iliana's [baptism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism) at [St. Catherine of Siena](http://www.stcathsiena.org/). We're having about 30 friends and family members coming to help us celebrate this wonderful day.

**Update:**

[Father John](http://www.stcathsiena.org/images/Fr%20John.jpg) did a wonderful job at the [baptism](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/07/06/baptism/) of our daughter Iliana just a few short weeks ago.
