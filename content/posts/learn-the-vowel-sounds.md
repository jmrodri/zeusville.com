I've always wondered by [gringos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gringo) have such a hard time with [Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language) words. I realized that if you get the vowel sounds right you can pronounce most words.Â  In [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), vowels have 2 different sounds whereas in [Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language) they have one. For instance, my son's name is Adan which is pronounced ah-dahn not uh-don the a sounds the same in all cases.

*   a - ah (like the sound the doctor asks you to make)
*   e - eh (short)
*   i - ee (like the long e in [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language))
*   o - oh (but a short oh not the drawn out oh from [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language))
*   u - oo (like a monkey)

So mono is not mah-noh, it's moh-noh. Marco (my other son's name) is pronounced "mahrr-coh". The hardest part about that is trilling the r which even I have a difficult time doing. So remember folks, if you learn the vowel sounds in [Spanish,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language) that will help you pronounce [Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language) words that much more effectively.
