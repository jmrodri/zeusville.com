I'm really glad Kerry picked Edwards as his running mate. There were rumors that he was looking at Hilary Clinton, which though it wouldn't have bothered me, I think it would've been political suicide for the Kerry campaign.

I am worried that the ticket is way left-liberal though. Being left of Ted Kennedy is not a good thing. A more moderal democrat probably would have appealed more.
