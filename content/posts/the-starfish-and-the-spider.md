I finished ["The Starfish and the Spider"](http://www.amazon.com/Starfish-Spider-Unstoppable-Leaderless-Organizations/dp/1591841437/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-6676131-3580641?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1190595425&sr=8-1) last week. Most of my friends and family will know how big of an accomplishment this is as I don't read many books. I usually get bored or distracted by them. I prefer the newspaper and magazines. The book talks about how starfish organizations (those that are decentralized) can be very powerful and adaptive. While spider organizations are very rigid and have single points of failure.Â  In short, it describes how companies which need to be centralized like spiders, can take lessons by decentralizing. I highly recommend this book.
