[Liz](http://emrodriguez.wordpress.com/) went to the beach with her friends on Friday night. She'll return sometime late this afternoon. She did take Iliana with her as she's a [wii](http://us.wii.com/) bit too small for me to handle alone. The boys stayed with me and we had a good time on Saturday.

The boys and I went to see "[Meet the Robinsons](http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/meettherobinsons/)". They liked it, but I'm not sure they really grasped the whole time shifting premise in the movie. Adan & Marco were so excited to go, they were hounding me since 9:30am. Finally, at 10:45am I figured I'd leave since I had to get money and wanted to get there early enough. Well we got there plenty early, so early that the theater wasn't open yet. They didn't open until 11:15am and our movie was at 11:45am. Oh well, c'est la vie. We walked around the shopping center a little until it was time.

After the movies, we came back home to give Marco another [breathing treatment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulizer) to make sure his [asthma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma) doesn't flare up too much with his cold. The boys then played a round of [Lego Star Wars](http://starwars.lego.com/en-us/VideoGame/Default.aspx) on the [Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/). Then around 3:30pm, we went off to [McDonald's](http://go.mappoint.net/mcdonaldsx/PrxDriveResults.aspx?&IC_O=35.9775911511245%3a-78.5395119828979%3a33%3a&IC_D=35.97%3a-78.53%3aRedCircle1%3a&GAD1_O=&GAD1_D=McDonald's&GAD2_O=&GAD2_D=865+DURHAM+RD&GAD3_O=27587+(postal+code)%2c+North+Carolina%2c+United+States&GAD3_D=WAKE+FOREST%2c+NC+27587&GCITY_O=&GCITY_D=WAKE+FOREST&GSTATE_O=&GSTATE_D=NC&GZIP_O=&GZIP_D=27587&GAD4_O=USA&GAD4_D=USA&DSN=MapPoint.NA). I let them play in the play area which we never let them do. Then back home for some more horsing around, and [Cars](http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/cars/) movie (I really like this movie).

Today, we played hooky from [church,](http://www.stcathsiena.org/) I made the boys pancakes and sausage . Gave them a little treat by allowing them to drink juice instead of milk with breakfast - (they get plenty of juice throughout the day). After I finish writing this, I'll take them to Border's book store (I don't care for Barnes & Noble).

That's it, maybe I'll grill some burgers tonight for dinner as the weather is gorgeous.
