It was a busy weekend, Liz went away for the weekend while I watched the 3 kids. They were actually very well behaved and gave me little to no trouble. I was expecting quite a bit :D We went to their Friday playgroup, afterwards had the kid's favorite: McDonald's for dinner. On Saturday, we went to Border's to get the kid's some books, I went with the intention to buy Doctor Who Season 2, but didn't want to pay the $68 for it. I ended up getting a Doctor Who book instead, yeah I'm as surprised as you that I ended up with a book.

In the evenings I spent the time catching up on my sci-fi shows: finished watching [Doctor Who](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_who) Season 4, saw all of Season 1 (I started with Season 2), and I started watching [Firefly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)) (thanks [robin](http://iwillbeeatenbyanalligator.blogspot.com/)). I also managed to get 2 [patches](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2036351&group_id=25164&atid=383549) submitted and accepted to [redstone-xmlrpc](http://xmlrpc.sourceforge.net/), and I submitted the package to [jpackage](http://jpackage.org) for review. Another library I use all the time is [jdbcLogDriver](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdbclogdriver/) written by a former colleague of mine, I got commit access to it this weekend as well. Today I started to shake the dust off [zmugfs](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=205794). I still haven't been able to add write access to the file system, and the read mode is extremely slow at startup. I need a better algorithm for downloading the photos and caching them.
