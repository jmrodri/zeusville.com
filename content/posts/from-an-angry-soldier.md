While perusing [digg](http://www.digg.com) today, I read the note from an angry soldier. It's quite sobering, and exactly why I've always thought the war in Iraq was senseless.

> I'm having the worst damn week of my whole damn life so I'm going to write this while I'm pissed off enough to do it right. I am SICK of all this bullshit people are writing about the Iraq war. I am abso-fucking-lutely sick to death of it. What the fuck do most of you know about it? You watch it on TV and read the commentaries in the newspaper or Newsweek or whatever god damn yuppie news rag you subscribe to and think you're all such fucking experts that you can scream at each other like five year old about whether you're right or not. Let me tell you something: unless you've been there, you don't know a god damn thing about it. It you haven't been shot at in that fucking hell hole, SHUT THE FUCK UP!
