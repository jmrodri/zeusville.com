While perusing [digg](http://www.digg.com) today, I read the note from an angry soldier. It's quite sobering, and exactly why I've always thought the war in Iraq was senseless.

> I'm having the worst damn week of my whole damn life so I'm going to write this while I'm pissed off enough to do it right.
>
> I am SICK of all this bullshit people are writing about the Iraq war. I am abso-fucking-lutely sick to death of it. What the fuck do most of you know about it? You watch it on TV and read the commentaries in the newspaper or Newsweek or whatever god damn yuppie news rag you subscribe to and think you're all such fucking experts that you can scream at each other like five year old about whether you're right or not. Let me tell you something: unless you've been there, you don't know a god damn thing about it. It you haven't been shot at in that fucking hell hole, SHUT THE FUCK UP!

These are the only three United States Marines killed in Iraq during the time frame the letter writer specified. As a female USMC Veteran I am calling bull pucky here. Staff Sgt. Marcus A. Golczynski, 30, of Lewisburg, Tenn., died March 27. Death release March 29th. this cant be her husband as she said she was notified Apri 7th. News release comes after notification of family. "The Tennessean's April 5 photograph of young Christian Golczynski accepting the American flag from Marine Lt. Col. Ric Thompson is one of the most moving and emotion provoking images I have ever seen. " his funeral already happened. he cant be the guy, period end of story. He is the son of Elaine Huffines of Lewisburg and Henry Golczynski of Murfreesboro. Fay and Henry Golczynski, owners of Franklin Printworks in Murfreesboro, received the news late Tuesday. Sgt. Golczynski had an 8-year-old son who lives with his mother in Maryland. During the service, Heather Golczynski said her husband had been her hero and their son's hero and that he would be missed. "I find comfort from looking at Christian and seeing Marc reflected" in his son, she said. Sound like the tone of that letter Pfc. Miguel A. Marcial III, 19, of Secaucus, N.J., died April 1 in Al Anbar province, Iraq. His death is currently under investigation. Date of news release April 3rd. "“He was only there a month. The whole thing is so shocking,'' he said." Cant be the guy the orginal poster said her husband was at the end of his tour and had been extended. From the funeral announcement of PFC Miguel A. Marcial III: Miguel was the beloved son of Miguel Jr. and Dianna; loving brother of Michael and Raquel; dear grandson of German and Luz Baez, and stepson of Lisa Lopez. No grieving widow. Lance Cpl. Daniel R. Olsen, 20, of Eagan, Minn., died April 2 while conducting combat operations in Al Anbar province, Iraq. Olsen was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, Twentynine Palms, Calif. Date of news release April 3rd. "He first was deployed on Jan. 28, 2007. His parents last spoke with him by telephone last weekend." This guy was no where close to the end of his 7th month deployed. Not to mention the unit has not been extended. L/Cpl Olsen: Survived by parents, Wayne & Gwen; sisters Shelcy & Shaina; and grandpa John Edstrom. Again no grieving widow. The next date of Marine KIAs prior to the dates that post on Craigslist covered was March 22. I hardly think it took the USMC until April 7th to notify the next of kin. I have no problem with anyone disagreeing with or even bashing the heck out of the Bush administration but I HATE WANNABES.

How do you know this is real? If it is, I'm sorry for her loss, but I'm a bit skeptical... it's posted to Craig's List from SF... with no name. Having read the full text it sounds phony to me.
