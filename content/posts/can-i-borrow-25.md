A friend of mine sent this to me via email, I usually don't pay attention to these, but I really liked this one. I'm thankful that my dad was always home for dinner and why I try to get home to have dinner with my family every night.

* * *

A man came home from work late, tired and irritated, to find his 5-year

old son waiting for him at the door.

SON: 'Daddy, may I ask you a question?'

DAD: 'Yeah sure, what it is?' replied the man.

SON: 'Daddy, how much do you make an hour?'

DAD: 'That's none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?' the man

said angrily.

SON: 'I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an hour?'

DAD: 'If you must know, I make $50 an hour.'

SON: 'Oh,' the little boy replied, with his head down.

SON: 'Daddy, may I please borrow $25?'

The father was furious, 'If the only reason you asked that is so you can

borrow some money to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then you march

yourself straight to your room and go to bed. Think about why you are being

so selfish. I don't work hard every day for such childish frivolities.' The

little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door.

The man sat down and started to get even angrier about the little boy's

questions. How dare he ask such questions only to get some money? After

about an hour or so, the man had calmed down , and started to think: Maybe

there was something he really needed to buy with that $25.00 and he really

didn't ask for money very often. The man went to the door of the little

boy's room and opened the door. 'Are you asleep, son?' He asked. 'No daddy,

I'm awake,' replied the boy. 'I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on

you earlier' said the man 'It's been a long day and I took out my

aggravation on you. Here's the $25 you asked for.'

The little boy sat straight up, smiling. 'Oh, thank you daddy!' He yelled.

Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled out some crumpled up bills. The

man saw that the boy already had money, started to get angry again. The

little boy slowly counted out his money, and then looked up at his father.

'Why do you want more money if you already have some?' the father grumbled.

Because I didn't have enough, but now I do,' the little boy replied. 'Daddy,

I have $50 now. Can I buy an

hour of your time? Please come home early tomorrow. I would like to have

dinner with you.'

The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little son, and he

begged for his forgiveness. It's just a short reminder to all of you working

so hard in life. We should not let time slip through our fingers without

having spent some time with those who really matter to us, those close to

our hearts. Do remember to share that $50 worth of your time with someone

you love.

If we die tomorrow, the company that we are working for could easily

replace us in a matter of hours. But the family & friends we leave behind

will feel the loss for the rest of their lives.

From my house to yours

'The light of God surrounds us.

The love of God enfolds us.

The power of God protects us.

The presence of God watches over us.

Wherever we are God is and all is well.'

From my home to yours - enjoy.
