![heroes_logo](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/images/common/heroes_logo.jpg) My latest TV addiction is [Heroes](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/) . I'm hoping it doesn't go the way of [Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index) where they keep asking question but never answer any. If I had special powers I would want those of [Claire](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/bios/claire.shtml), indestructible. Then I'd pick the ability to bend time and space like [Hiro](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/cast/hiro.shtml).
