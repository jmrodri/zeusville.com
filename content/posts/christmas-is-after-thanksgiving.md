One of my favorite holiday's is [Christmas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas). But the media and retail establishments in the US are ruining [Christmas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas). They start decorating stores in [Christmas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) gear on November 1st. Radio stations are playing [Christmas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) music all day already. What happened to Thanksgiving? Are we just going to skip that holiday? And for those people that have forgotten when [Christmas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) is, use this website: [http://www.isitchristmas.com/](http://www.isitchristmas.com/). I refuse to listen to Christmas music before Thanksgiving is over. To me the [Christmas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) season starts the day **AFTER** Thanksgiving. So remember, it's Halloween, followed by Thanksgiving, **THEN** [Christmas.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) At the rate we're going [Christmas in July](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_July) will become a reality.
