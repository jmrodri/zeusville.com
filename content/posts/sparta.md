We saw "[300](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film))" last night.  This movie is awesome! It ranks up there with one of my favorite movies ["Gladiator"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_%28film%29).

Wow, with all the subtle, pointed blog posts you've made lately, I can't help but wonder what the hidden message is in this one? http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0416449/Yahoo.jpg.html Ah. Got it.

Seriously? I couldn't stand the movie. I thought it was gayer than The Crying Game.
