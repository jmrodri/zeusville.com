I think I found my new favorite programming language: [Python](http://www.python.org/). After 10 years of Java, Python is quite refreshing. Here are what I like and dislike about the language. Like

*   typesafe without having to declare types
*   proper amount of verbosity i.e. if not valid instead of if !valid.
*   indentation forces a common coding standard
*   the fact that objects can be treated as maps (dict in python parlance)

Dislike:

*   the lack of a marker to end a block of code i.e. }, end, fi, etc.
*   lack of semi-colon (;) while it's optional it looks stupid with other python code, but not using it makes it hard to switch between languages.
*   passing self to methods

All in all Python is kickass. Now [perl](http://www.perl.org/) SUCKS!
