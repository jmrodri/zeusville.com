I think I found my new favorite programming language: [Python](http://www.python.org/). After 10 years of Java, Python is quite refreshing.

Here are what I like and dislike about the language.

Like

*   typesafe without having to declare types

*   proper amount of verbosity i.e. if not valid instead of if !valid.

*   indentation forces a common coding standard

*   the fact that objects can be treated as maps (dict in python parlance)

Dislike:

*   the lack of a marker to end a block of code i.e. }, end, fi, etc.

*   lack of semi-colon (;) while it's optional it looks stupid with other python code, but not using it makes it hard to switch between languages.

*   passing self to methods

All in all Python is kickass. Now [perl](http://www.perl.org/) SUCKS!

Nice comment :) and I have to say working in python has been quite refreshing after doing java for the last 9 years.

I still hate the fact that you can change the return values and you won't know the pain until runtime. But yeah, beats the hell out of perl.

Sorry man, I like perl. It has a bunch of what you just documented Python lacks...
