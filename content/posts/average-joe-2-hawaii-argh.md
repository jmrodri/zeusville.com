Ok I admit it, I watched [Average Joe 2: Hawaii](http://www.nbc.com/Average_Joe:_Hawaii/) and I was really disappointed with Larissa. It's obvious that Brian, the average joe, would've been better for her, yet she choose the "pretty boy". In the end, she got was she deserved "pretty boy" dumpped her when he found out she dated [Fabio](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=fabio&btnG=Google+Search).

"pretty boy" was completely freaked out that Larissa dated Fabio, don't know why though. I'm sure Brian wouldn't have cared.
