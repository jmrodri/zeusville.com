[Yesterday](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2009/07/26/where-is-my-1600x1200-leonidas/) I posted about trying to get my old CRT to do 1600x1200 again using Fedora 11. Yesterday I had an incorrect xorg.conf, here's the correct one that is working for me. The key to my problem was adding the Modeline to the Monitor section **NOT** to the Display section. After putting this xorg.conf into action I got 1600x1200 from the gdm login screen onwards. I don't think there is any hope for the bootup screens they still show up with some awful resolution.```
