Version 1.20 of [sm-photo-tool](http://github.com/jmrodri/sm-photo-tool/) is ready to go. You can download it from github: [http://github.com/jmrodri/sm-photo-tool/downloads](http://github.com/jmrodri/sm-photo-tool/downloads).

The following are new configuration options:

*   square thumbs

*   hide owner

*   world searchable

*   smug searchable

*   sort method

*   max size option added to create

Bugs fixed:

*   If filename ends with +, append instead of overwriting log file

Thanks got Lloyd Cha for contributing the fixes for this release.

I have been trying to get this working. It seems up upload correctly without any error messages and the correctly named gallery is created, but when I look in the gallery there are not any images in it. What am I doing wrong.
