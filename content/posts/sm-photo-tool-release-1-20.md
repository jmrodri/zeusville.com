The following are new configuration options:

*   square thumbs

*   hide owner

*   max size option added to create

Bugs fixed:

I have been trying to get this working. It seems up upload correctly without any error messages and the correctly named gallery is created, but when I look in the gallery there are not any images in it. What am I doing wrong.
