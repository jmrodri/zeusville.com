Well, they also sell hard disks where 15% off is less than $10. Sounds plausible.

What's the issue here? They have many small hard drives for less than $67 which will get the full 15%, the limitation was not in fine print, and neither was the fact that there was a dollar limit to the total discounts given. Nothing deceptive, and I got got full 15% off on a pair of small drives to be given as presents to byte deprived children.
