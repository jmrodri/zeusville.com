While I'm on the [subject of cars](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/08/16/car-family-tree/), I've owned a few cars myself (while I'm here I'll list the ones my wife owned to):

My list of vehicles goes like this:

*   [1981 Dodge Aries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Aries) (burgundy, with a 4-speed manual, complete with vinyl bench seat)

*   [1988 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevy_Cavalier) (red, tan cloth interior, 5-speed manual, 2.8L V-6)

*   [1995 Pontiac Trans Am](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_Trans_Am#Fourth_generation) (black, leather, t-tops, 6-speed manual, 5.7L LT1 V-8: still own[SOLD](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/trans-am-sold-officially-this-time/))

*   [2007 Mazda Mazdaspeed3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazdaspeed3) (blue, leather, 6-speed manual, 2.3L turbocharged I-4)

My wife has had a similar list of vehicles, though not quite as new:

*   [1979 Chevrolet Nova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Nova#Fourth_generation_.281975.E2.80.931979.29) (red & purple, no radio, hole in the floor pan)

*   [1984 Oldsmobile Delta 88](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Delta_88#1977-85) (burgundy, nice luxury car)

*   [1999 Hyundai Elantra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Elantra#Second_generation_.281996.E2.80.932000.29) (white)

*   [2003 Ford Taurus SEL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Taurus#Fourth_generation_.282000.E2.80.932007.29) wagon (silver, leather, fully loaded)

*   [2006 Dodge Grand Caravan SXT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Grand_Caravan#2001-2007) (blue, leather, DVD, and more:currently own)

There's a walk down my car history :)
