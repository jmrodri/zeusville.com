After last weeks [fiasco](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/10/01/ta-in-a-new-shop/) at Wake Tire, the car has been happily getting worked on by the guys at [Carolina Auto Masters](http://www.carolinaautomasters.com/). My top three things to get fixed were:

1.  car wouldn't start
2.  rough idle
3.  overheats at idle

The solutions to the above were:

1.  needed a battery and a starter
2.  catalytic converter issue
3.  bad fan relay

I then had them look at a few other issues:

*   A/C not working
*   change rear diff fluid
*   flush radiator coolant

They're waiting for parts, hopefully it'll be done today. At least they made progress unlike the first shop that had it.
