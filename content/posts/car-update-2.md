After last weeks [fiasco](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/10/01/ta-in-a-new-shop/) at Wake Tire, the car has been happily getting worked on by the guys at [Carolina Auto Masters](http://www.carolinaautomasters.com/). My top three things to get fixed were:

3.  car wouldn't start

6.  rough idle

9.  overheats at idle

The solutions to the above were:

3.  needed a battery and a starter

6.  catalytic converter issue

9.  bad fan relay

I then had them look at a few other issues:

*   A/C not working

*   change rear diff fluid

*   flush radiator coolant

They're waiting for parts, hopefully it'll be done today. At least they made progress unlike the first shop that had it.
