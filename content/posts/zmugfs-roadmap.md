I released [zmugfs 0.1](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/10/31/zmugfs-01-released/) on October 31st, 2007, but I haven't done anything else with it since then. I'm overdue for finishing it. Next up is to add the write mode capability to the file system which will actually allow you to upload your photos to [smugmug.com](http://www.smugmug.com). Here's a quick list:

*   ability to create:
    *   albums
    *   categories
    *   subcategories
*   upload photos
*   edit attributes of photos (not quite sure how this will work)

Stay tuned for more.
