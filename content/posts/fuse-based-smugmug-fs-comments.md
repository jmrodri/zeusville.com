This is such a cool idea! I'm the CEO & Chief Geek at SmugMug, and would love to see this. Definitely drop us a note if there's any help we can give, or if you need the API extended in some way. Our API forum is the place to be, if you haven't checked it out already: http://www.dgrin.com/forumdisplay.php?f=25 Thanks, and good luck!

hello. have you made progress on this front? will this FUSE fs work with osx? i am extremely disappointed that all of the cloud image storage sites do not offer any filesystem connection, and furthermore no sync ability. currently im using dropbox to store images, and was hoping i could do bi-directional sync with them to smugmug like i did with picasaweb. thx!
