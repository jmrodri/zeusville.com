It's amazing how fast time flies. A year ago today, we [announced](https://www.redhat.com/archives/spacewalk-list/2008-June/msg00000.html) project [Spacewalk](http://spacewalk.redhat.com).

![Spacewalk](http://www.redhat.com/spacewalk/img/spacewalk-logo.png)

In that year, we've had [five](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/roadmap?show=all) releases on three Linux versions: RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and Fedora 10. Currently we're working on getting [Spacewalk 0.6](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/milestone/Release%20-%200.6) ready for [Fedora 11](http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/f11/). Want to help? Check us out on #spacewalk and #spacewalk-devel on freenode or contact us on [spacewalk mailing list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/spacewalk-list).

We also added quite a few features to the project:

*   Lot's of new [APIs](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/ApiAdditions)

*   Enhanced [search](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/Features/SearchImprovements) capabilities

*   [SELinux](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/Features/SELinux) support

*   Added [channel sharing and system migration](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/Features/MultiOrg2) as part of multi-org 2 feature

*   [Integration](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/CobblerKoanIntegration) with [cobbler](https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/)

*   Began [PostgreSQL](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/PathToPostgreSql) migration

Rahul, there is no real ETA for getting into Fedora. It is highly dependent on when the PostgreSQL migration finishes. Then there there is the issue of getting all of the Java packages we use into Fedora.

**Happy Birthday Spacewalk...** Zeus pointed out that today marks the 1 year birthday of Spacewalk being announced. He mentions some of the technical accomplishments made during that time, but there are a few other aspects I find important: Like he mentions, there have been 5 relea...

Congrats. What is the ETA for it to be on the Fedora (and EPEL) repo?

And most importantly, added me to the team during that time. You might want to update your post bullet points to mention that fact.
