It's amazing how fast time flies. A year ago today, we [announced](https://www.redhat.com/archives/spacewalk-list/2008-June/msg00000.html) project [Spacewalk](http://spacewalk.redhat.com).

In that year, we've had [five](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/roadmap?show=all) releases on three Linux versions: RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and Fedora 10. Currently we're working on getting [Spacewalk 0.6](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/milestone/Release%20-%200.6) ready for [Fedora 11](http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/f11/). Want to help? Check us out on #spacewalk and #spacewalk-devel on freenode or contact us on [spacewalk mailing list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/spacewalk-list).

We also added quite a few features to the project:

*   Lot's of new [APIs](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/ApiAdditions)

*   Enhanced [search](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/Features/SearchImprovements) capabilities

*   [SELinux](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/Features/SELinux) support

*   Added [channel sharing and system migration](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/Features/MultiOrg2) as part of multi-org 2 feature

*   [Integration](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/CobblerKoanIntegration) with [cobbler](https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/)

*   Began [PostgreSQL](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/PathToPostgreSql) migration
