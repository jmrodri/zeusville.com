Just received a call from **1-202-456-7890** (notice the increasing numbers) telling me that I've been selected by the "government" for a $9,000 grant. It is only given to those citizens that pay their taxes on time, no bankruptcies, etc. Apparently I can use this money for whatever I want home repair, buy a new car, etc. EXCEPT for gambling. I can receive this money in one of two ways either a bank account (savings, checking, money market) or a "**_plastic account_**" that is credit card, debit card, etc. I asked if this money was subject to income tax, they said NO (yeah right), then I asked to have a certified check mailed to a PO Box. They said it can only be sent via bank or plastic account. The "government" has not authorized payment via check.

At this point I grew tired of his bulls\*\*t and said that I'm going to report them to the FTC, FBI and FCC. Do not call my number anymore. After I hung up I called the number to see if it was indeed a fake one, and sure enough "you've reached a non-working number".

So if you get a Washington, DC or any call asking for information, don't give it to them. It is fun playing along though :)

The FTC already has this scam in various forms:

* [Another chapter in free grant fiction](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/another-chapter-free-grant-fiction)
* [Search "grant" on FTC.GOV](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/search/site/grant)
