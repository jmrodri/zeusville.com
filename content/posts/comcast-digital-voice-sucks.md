So I had my mom sign up for Comcast's Digital Voice and High Speed Internet as their current special of $33 per service is cheaper than what she was paying for phone with [Verizon](http://www.verizon.com). Since she got the service the phone has cut out for 3 - 4 hours a day. Comcast says that will happen when there is work in the neighborhood, but daily for a week?

He told my mom that the router could damage the phone/internet box. I think that's BS!
