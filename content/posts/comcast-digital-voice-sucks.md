So I had my mom sign up for Comcast's Digital Voice and High Speed Internet as their current special of $33 per service is cheaper than what she was paying for phone with [Verizon](http://www.verizon.com). Since she got the service the phone has cut out for 3 - 4 hours a day. Comcast says that will happen when there is work in the neighborhood, but daily for a week? Then they sent out a technician that came out and saw that I added a [Linksys WRT54G](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1149562300349&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&lid=0034939789B01) wireless router. He told my mom that the router could damage the phone/internet box. I think that's BS!

Also, the technician says their [Uniden](http://www.comcast.com/customers/faq/FaqDetails.ashx?Id=3197) cordless phone is not compatible with the service. Again, they advertise it works with your existing phones and yet here they are coming up with "issues". So they wanted her to buy a new phone. Again, BS!

And to top it off, they told her she would have to pay the $150 fee to cancel.

So now I have to make a few calls to get it resolved, and according to their [website](http://http://www.comcast.com/customers/faq/FaqDetails.ashx?Id=2775), I shouldn't have to pay the $150:
