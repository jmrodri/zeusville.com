Many folks at work ask me which Java IDE I prefer, I usually answer [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), which is the IDE I'm hoping we migrate to. Personally, I've never been an IDE fan. I much prefer [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) scripts, a good editor like [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), and a compiler such as [Jikes](http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/).

Enough rambling, [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) is really a great IDE. The SWT makes it fast and look like other native applications which is one of my biggest problems with Swing. It's slow and doesn't behave like Windows or Linux. Eclipse has a large list of availble [plugins](http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net/eclipse/index.jsp)

Here are a few of my favorites:

[Lomboz J2EE](http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net/eclipse/plugin_details.jsp?id=38)  
[Omondo UML](http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net/eclipse/plugin_details.jsp?id=151)  
[VI plugin](http://www.mjwall.com/node/view/29)  

There's also an effort to port the SWT to work with [OS/2](http://www-3.ibm.com/software/os/warp/) and get Eclipse running, check out [http://eclipseos2.netlabs.org/](http://eclipseos2.netlabs.org/).
