Many folks at work ask me which Java IDE I prefer, I usually answer
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), which is the IDE I'm hoping we migrate to.
Personally, I've never been an IDE fan. I much prefer [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
scripts, a good editor like [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), and a compiler such as
[Jikes](http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/).

Enough rambling, [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) is really a great IDE. The
SWT makes it fast and look like other native applications which is one of my
biggest problems with Swing. It's slow and doesn't behave like Windows or
Linux. Eclipse has a large list of availble [plugins](http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net/eclipse/index.jsp)

Here are a few of my favorites:

[Lomboz J2EE](http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net/eclipse/plugin_details.jsp?id=38)
[Omondo UML](http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net/eclipse/plugin_details.jsp?id=151)
[VI plugin](http://www.mjwall.com/node/view/29)

There's also an effort to port the SWT to work with [OS/2](http://www-3.ibm.com/software/os/warp/)
and get Eclipse running, check out [http://eclipseos2.netlabs.org/](http://eclipseos2.netlabs.org/).

Thanks for the link. However, I didn't make the vi plugin. Michael Bartl did.
His project page is [http://satokar.com/viplugin/](http://satokar.com/viplugin/)
and the sourceforge page is [http://sourceforge.net/projects/viplugin]( http://sourceforge.net/projects/viplugin).
