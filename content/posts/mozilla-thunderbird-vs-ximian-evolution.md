I've been using [Fedora Core 1](http://fedora.redhat.com) for a few months now. I like it. I'm eagerly awaiting [Core 2](http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/test/1.90/i386/) due out sometime in April.

When I installed Fedora Core 1, Red Hat 8 & 9 before that, I was using [Evolution](http://www.ximian.com/products/evolution/) as my email client. It has a lot of power like Calendar, a startup page with news and weather, ability to connect to [Exchange](http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.asp), and a host of other things. At work we use Exchange for the calendaring (and companies like Exchange instead of SMTP/POP3 don't know why). At home, I don't need the features Evolution has to offer. One of the things I also don't like is the alternating gray lines in it's lists.

Prior to using Linux I used OS/2 Warp 4 (yes it's still alive believe it or not), and my favorite OS/2 application was [PMMail](http://www.pmmail2000.com/) for email. I used it for 6 years and have yet to find a Linux mailer as nice.

I tried [Balsa](http://balsa.gnome.org/) but like balsa wood, it felt soft and weak. Not as polished as Evolution or PMMail. [Mozilla Mail](http://www.mozilla.org) seems too heavy weight since I don't use Mozilla the browser either. So the saga continues.

When I switched to [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) for browsing, I was impressed with its polish and speed. And I remembered Mozilla was working on a new mail client [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/). I decided to give it a try. I'm pretty impressed with it so far. None of the extra corporate features of Evolution, but a nice simple interface (no alternating lines in the lists) and "feels" like the closest thing I've found to PMMail for Linux.

Unfortunately, making the switch from Evolution to Thunderbird required a little hack to get my Evolution email over to Thunderbird since there isn't any import feature. I think Thunderbird would benefit with an email importer from Outlook, Outlook Express, Navigator, Mozilla Mail, Evolution, and standard mbox format. This will make it easier for users to switch to Thunderbird for their emailing needs.
