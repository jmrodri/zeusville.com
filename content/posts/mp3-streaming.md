I'm planning on installing [icecast](http://www.icecast.org/) on my home Linux server to stream my MP3 collection.

There are going to be some requirements that I need to figure out:  
1) must be accessible to me and me alone. I don't want anyone else listening  
2) have the ability to listen to any song I want  
3) easy to use
