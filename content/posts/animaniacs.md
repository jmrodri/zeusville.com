I must be getting old, since I don't find today's cartoons very amusing or entertaining. I'm a big Looney Toons fan, where the skits were short and full of gags. Now cartoons are like soaps with plots and stuff.

In the early 1990's, a refreshing cartoon was on the air called [Animaniacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaniacs). That was hilarious. My favorite was Wakko. I wonder what happened to them.

What happened to them? It stopped being silly, then became a cartoon musical, and then everybody stopped watching. I know I stopped watching when every episode was a musical. :(
