A little background. For those that don't know, I own a 1995 [Pontiac](http://www.pontiac.com) Trans Am. In high school, I always dreamed of a [Camaro](http://www.chevrolet.com) and ultimately a [Porsche 911](http://content3.us.porsche.com/prod/911/911_main04.nsf/usaenglish/911). I chose the Trans Am because I didn't like the fourth generation Camaro's, they looked like Geo Storms on steroids. Plus, the Trans Am reminded me of K.I.T.T.

Well, with all the rain we've had here in Wake Forest, the car was stumbling on the way home Friday night, and today it didn't want to turn over (start). I have a strong feeling the [Optispark](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=f-body+optispark&btnG=Search) distributor is either wet or bit the bucket. So I'll have to take the Bird in to the shop sometime this week. :(
