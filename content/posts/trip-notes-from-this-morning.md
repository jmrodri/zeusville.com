Today I got up at 3:15am for a 6:00am flight to San Antonio, TX to visit a

customer. There's was no traffic at 4:00am. I printed the boarding pass the

night before to avoid lines at the airport, which worked quite well because I

could go straight to my gate via security.

The first leg of my flight, Raleigh, NC to Atlanta, GA, went smooth.

The plane had a cool multimedia screen in the back of each sat, free HBO,

and satellite TV. The system had games as well, such as klondike, chess,

and even sodoku, but they charge a fee which I'm not willing to pay when I

could just as easily use my laptop. Another cool feature of the multimedia

system was it had popular CDs you could play, like a jukebox. I'm listening

to Gwen Stefani as I write this. And just announced over the PA, the right

side of the plane's multimedia system is malfunctioning so I'm on the lucky

side of the plane.

I left RDU about 10 minutes late because the lavatory in first class

had been filled with too much fluid. Unfortunately, I'm struggling to

come up with a potty joke :) Oh well, we can't always be on top of our

game.

On the flight, I was to sit in seat 37B but fortunately the folks in

seats A and C switched with me. So I'm now comfortable in an aisle seat.

Also, the folks are on their way to Puerto Rico for vacation and to see

family. The daughter is on her first flight ever even though she

appears to be 12. I'm thankful my parents took us on flights when we

were young, especially in the 70's and 80's when we got wings from the

pilots and hot food instead of these crappy ass "biscoff" cookies.

We've been in the air about an hour and are now making our descent into

Atlanta (ATL). I'll type more later.

INTERMISSION

After a quick layover, one hour, in Atlanta, I'm off on another flight

to San Antonio, TX (SAT). The MD-88 plane I'm on is no where near as

nice as the one from RDU-ATL. Though that plane was to continue on to

Phoenix which is a much longer flight hence all the amenities.

To maximize my visit, I hope I can stay until 5pm (for a 6:26pm flight).

We'll see how long it takes to go from the airport to the customer's

site, and how bad traffic will be in the evening.

I think I might try and take a little nap, but it'll be hard since the

seat back only reaches the base of my neck, and my mile long legs won't

allow me to scoot forward in my seat. I'll see what happens.

More later.
