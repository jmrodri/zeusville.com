`load-module module-hal-detect **tsched=0**`

Depends on hardware. On some configs tsched=0 can make PA even more crashy.

When this 'fixes' things for you, it means your sound driver (at the kernel level) is buggy, and you ought to file a bug. We want to have all remaining cases of this problem fixed. Thanks.
