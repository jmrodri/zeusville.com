Well, in the bizarre twist that is my life, my Trans Am has fallin

ill. On the way home last night at the corner of Old Wake Forest

Road and Capital, I swerved to avoid a box. But I couldn't avoid it

and ran over it. Immediately, I heard a big boom and the car "jumped"

as if I ran over a big box with something in it. White smoke everywhere.

I pulled over, and turned off the car. I got out opened the hood

and smelled burning oil. "Crap" I thought to myself. Looked

under the car and saw oil pouring out. The car filled with smoke.

At this point I'm both pissed and curious. What was it that

I ran over?

I walked back to see what was in the box. I noticed a large

automobile piece in the road, I ran to get it. "This must've

been what was in the box". I look for a payphone (which

are practically non-existent these days). Called from the

Just Tires on Capital to get my wife to pick me up. I went

back to the car to wait. I looked at the piece that I hit

some more.

It looked like a steering column. But it wasn't very new.

Hmm odd. Looked back at the box, now flying around, not much

around except some stuffed animals and what looks like a CD.

After further examining the car part, I noticed "... GM Service".

Could it be? Holy crap, it's from MY CAR!!!!! In the street,

I could see a scrap in the asphault and a divot. Then a trail

of oil. It all makes sense now, the white smoke, the busted

oil pan, and the "jump". It wasn't the car, it was the coincidence

that my steering shaft busted as I was turning to avoid running over

a box.

So this is how I start my holiday vacation. Never a dull

moment. It's also how my week has been going. I'll be

getting it towed tomorrow and hopefully, it can be fixed

since I don't really want a new car right now. :(

I always said you should have bought a Mustang! :-) You were lucky it did not pole vault the car worse than it did!
