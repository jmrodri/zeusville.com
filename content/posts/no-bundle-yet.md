Friday afternoon Liz started having contractions (much like she did with Marco).  They continued all night long. She slept about 20 minutes total. The contractions continued all day Saturday, then at 6pm we call the doctor, and drive to the hospital.  The contractions got stronger, but no cervix dialation occurred, we spent the night in the hospital just to be sure.  Around 1am, the contractions stopped.  We left with no bundle of joy, at 7am Sunday morning. Now the bets begin will we make it to our due date? If not, when?
