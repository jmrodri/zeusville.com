For half a millennium, "the holidays" has meant Christmas and New Year's; you can also nameTwelfth Night and Little Christmas or Epiphany, if you like. Adding Thanksgiving is merely a commercial plug to sell "stuff." Hallowe'en has crept into the recipe, yes. Should we celebrate Christmas beginning with Independence Day? How far back should we go? As a traditionalist (lonely as it has become, though warm and satisfying anyway,) I put up a tree about 3 days before Christmas and celebrate heartily through the Christmas season (which begins for me at midnight, Christmas Eve) and on and on through the dark, dismal, dreary, sunless days till Spring. If you are depressed by all the darkness, just leave your Christmas lights up a bit longer. Dickens wrote about Christmas in our hearts all the year 'round. He did not mean how large a TV to buy nor the cost of gifts to impress anyone.
