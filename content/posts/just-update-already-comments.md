@bochecha: yum-updatesd has been present on every Fedora 10 install I have done.

" @bochecha: yum-updatesd has been present on every Fedora 10 install I have done. " Comps doesn't indicate it being installed by default.

That is the first thing I do after an install.

Wait, yum-updatesd ? Wasn't it replaced by the PackageKit daemon ? I think I haven't heard of yum-updatesd on my system since Fedora 10, it wasn't installed by default here... Also, the yum messages are quite different with latest versions... Are you stil on Fedora 9 ? If so, you might really want to upgrade. PackageKit works in a different way. You don't have a daemon blocking you for such a long time. And when it does block you (usually just after a previous yum operation), it does so for a very short time.
