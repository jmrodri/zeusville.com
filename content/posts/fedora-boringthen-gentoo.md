I've been playing with Fedora for a little over 10 days. And X combined with [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) is no where near as fast as Windows XP is on my PIII 650 with 512MB RAM using an NVIDIA GeForce2. The GUI seems much snappier in Windows.

So I ventured to try and install [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org) linux. I have to admit it is a very neat concept where you compile your customized version of Linux right on your hardware. It took me 3 days to get this up and running. But I couldn't get KDE to run since I'm too lazy to investigate further. So after 3 days, Gentoo will be gone.

I'm not sure I will ever be happy. I want a Linux that has a GUI that is as fast as Windows and as easy to use. But with the crash and virus protection of Linux.
