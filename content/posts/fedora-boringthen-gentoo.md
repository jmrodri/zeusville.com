I've been playing with Fedora for a little over 10 days. And X combined with [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) is no where near as fast as Windows XP is on my PIII 650 with 512MB RAM using an NVIDIA GeForce2. The GUI seems much snappier in Windows.

So I ventured to try and install [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org) linux. I have to admit it is a very neat concept where you compile your customized version of Linux right on your hardware. It took me 3 days to get this up and running. But I couldn't get KDE to run since I'm too lazy to investigate further. So after 3 days, Gentoo will be gone.

I'm not sure I will ever be happy. I want a Linux that has a GUI that is as fast as Windows and as easy to use. But with the crash and virus protection of Linux.

It exists. Mac OS X :) Get a Mac and don't look back...

Funny I was going to post exactly the same comment :-)) Though I have Gentoo running fine with both Kde and Gnome, only use the latter though.

Umm.. there are way faster windowmanagers than KDE and/or Gnome. Have a look at fluxbox, windowmaker, icewm & Co. instead if you want a snappier X.

I've been running Gentoo on my laptop since April, I must say it is the best linux distribution i've stumbled on. GREAT package management. My machine is a P4 1,6GHz laptop, and I'm running the latest Gnome (2.4) and it rocks! However, Gnome is quite the memory hog and it does take a while to load it up and everything. Since we're on the subject, the thing that made me switch to Linux (for anything related to work and school, i do have Win XP installed if i need to use something that's only available for Windoze) was that I wanted a stable working environment with all the development tools available. And I got it. I want a snappy GUI as well as the robustness of a UNIX system... If I ever have the money, I'm thinking OS X ;)

Have you set your Harddrives to use DMA? Gnome shouldn't be slower then XP.

I run Gentoo with KDE on my laptop and it is very fast. Gentoo can be tough to install though. I believe you that Fedora is slow, Red Hat has always seemed a little bloated to me. If you want an fast, easy to get up and running, non-bloated linux distro, go with slackware (http://www.slackware.org). i used Slackware for a couple of years before I switched to Gentoo. -Jackson
