I got used to having the shorter cube walls after a while. Decent headphones help a lot to get rid of the outside noise. It's still nowhere near as nice as having the high cubicle walls, but it's livable. I find the thought of software engineers without whiteboards in their cubes kind of mind-boggling, though.

It could be worse. At a previous job where management went all "agile" crazy, they took away our cubes entirely and just gave us tables. I can't tell you how many times we tripped over wires that had to be laid across the floor to read the walls to actually, ya know, plug in. And if one of us got sick, a single sneeze basically took out the whole team for a week. It gets worse. Management reprimanded my team for not having the "buzz" of chatter that's supposed to arise from removing the cube walls and working in an agile environment. I never did figure out when they expected us to actually get work done amidst all that talking we were supposed to be doing.
