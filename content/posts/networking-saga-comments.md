gee.. how many computers do you have that you need all those wired ports? Or are you stringing wires to phone jacks all over the house? I have been thinking about runing wires to all rooms. I was thinking about having a wired-only hub in the crawlspace and put the main router in a closet somewhere. For wireless, you almost need to have it placed in a room in the center of that house. Haven't done any of this yet, but I am thinking about it. -todd
