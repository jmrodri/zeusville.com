Also, when copying files target should be /etc/systemd/system; /lib is for package manager, /etc is for admin.

You need to read http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Systemd#How\_do\_I\_customize\_a\_unit\_file.2F\_add\_a\_custom\_unit\_file.3F It is much more simpler than what you are doing

I agree with Miguel. The root cause of these timeout problems is port status being open/close or fire wall. You must have a strong background on iptables maintenance. Meaning you'll be making updates in the iptables. What goes into the iptables and follows after an iptables updates.

Miguel, If you are getting a connection timeout I'd double check your port numbers and iptables. Make sure that which ever number you are using for your vncserver matches 590x port number. For example, if you choose 1 port = 5901, 2 then 5902. Also, don't use 0 because that's the remote-desktop vino-server listening on 5900.

I Can't "sudo systemctl enable vncserver@:3.service" Because, Fedora19 say " Failed to issue method call: File exists."

I am able to get around "getpassword error: Inappropriate ioctl for device" problem by installing tigervnc (yum install vnc)

Hi there. I have installed a fresh copy of fedora 16 64bit. I follow all the above steps but when i type 'sudo systemctl start vncserver@:3.service' i get this error. 'Job failed. See system logs and 'systemctl status' for details.' And in /var/log/messages i see the following. 'May 7 15:50:34 Simba runuser\[1625\]: You will require a password to access your desktops. May 7 15:50:34 Simba runuser\[1625\]: getpassword error: Inappropriate ioctl for device May 7 15:50:34 Simba systemd\[1\]: vncserver@:3.service: control process exited, code=exited status=1 May 7 15:50:34 Simba systemd\[1\]: Unit vncserver@:3.service entered failed state.' Also tried running yum update before installing vncserver but stil no luck.
