Back in December I had an ordeal with [DHL](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/dhl-are-freakin-idiots/), and they think [Russell Davies](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2005/03/dhl_when_it_abs.html?cid=103835514) is at fault for not being there when DHL attempted to drop off his parcel.
