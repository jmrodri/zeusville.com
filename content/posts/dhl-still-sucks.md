Back in December I had an ordeal with [DHL](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/dhl-are-freakin-idiots/), and they think [Russell Davies](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2005/03/dhl_when_it_abs.html?cid=103835514) is at fault for not being there when DHL attempted to drop off his parcel.

We've banned DHL from use. We had a parcel (in the US) shipped to the UK, paid for by the UK receiver. There was apparently a typo in the account number, so they billed me (the pickup point). I called the UK receiver, they figured out that it was a typo, and paid DHL in the UK for the shipment. DHL in the US said they had NO WAY OF COMMUNICATING with DHL in the UK, so they insisted I had to pay them too. No amount of effort on the receiver's part, or DHL in the UK could convince DHL in the US that payment was made. I eventually ended up paying to prevent a mark on my credit. DHL successfully extorted a double payment, but it was the last business they will ever get from us. I will pay more to have products shipped by another carrier rather that do business with them ever again.
