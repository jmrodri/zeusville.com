"JSF I'm not quite sold on yet." http://wicket.sf.net/ "Sometimes I wonder if we Java guys have lost our ability to write software without bringing in a truck load of heavyweight tools." wicket-1.1.1.zip, 6.1MB, more than 500 classes and interfaces in the public API... who said that Java zealots can't read?

just dont use hibernate or struts. you can always use plain jsp and jdbc, or an object oriented database. if your application is simple, it is a pain to use them anyway..

\[quote\] We Java guys always reach for our frameworks without really thinking if they are too much for the problem at hand.\[/quote\] Speak for yourself. ;-) Seriously, not everybody does that. And there \*are\* times when Java developers reach for Spring or Hibernate or Tapestry or Struts, etc. after careful deliberation, and it's the right choice. I agree with what I think is your point; that the decision to introduce these frameworks is something that needs to be considered carefully and the pros and cons weighed. But they do exist for a reason, they do solve real, legitimate problems, and they often do simplify development. I think it's a bit of a reach to suggest that we, as a whole, have forgotten how to do things without "a truckload of heavyweight tools." And that's without even getting into the whole thing (which Hani hit on a while back in the Bile Blog) of what exactly is a "heavyweight" vs. "lightweight" framework? Is Struts heavyweight? Is Hibernate? If so, how do we know? And are there lightweight alternatives?
