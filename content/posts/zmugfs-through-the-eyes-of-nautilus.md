[zmugfs](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/?s=zmugfs) is moving along slowly, but I'm pretty happy with the progress I've made so far. Learning [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) and about filesystem calls has been extremely interesting. I started out trying to get [mkdir](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/08/24/categories-subcategories-and-albums-oh-my/) to work and realized I'm better off getting the read only part done first :) Tonight I asked myself "I wonder what it looks like through nautilus?" So here is what it looks like. I've got a few inode issues (as you can tell by the ...) but still it's cool that I can actually see things :) ![zmugfs viaÂ nautilus](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/zmugfs_via_nautilus.png)
