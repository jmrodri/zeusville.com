I've looked at the different widget toolkits for Java ([AWT](http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/awt/), [Swing](http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html), & [SWT](http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-SWT-Design-1/SWT-Design-1.html)). And I think SWT is great. Just what Java needed. IBM did Java a great service by creating the SWT. It allows Java applications to run with native looking widgets and near native speed.

AWT was a good start, but not quite there. And Swing, well, you get native looking widgets, but it is dog slow (no offense to dog owners, I too love dogs). I'd like to start seeing more Java applications using SWT. The OS/2 folks (yes there are still some out there, I used to be one of them but just had to throw in the towel) are attempting to port the SWT to OS/2 to run Eclipse, check out [eclipseos2.netlabs.org](http://eclipseos2.netlabs.org/).
