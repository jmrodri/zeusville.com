I have a [Canon](http://www.canonusa.com) S750 inkjet printer connected to RHEL 4 shared via CUPS. From Windows, I get outstanding print quality. But using the Canon S600 drivers from Fedora gives me faded output. :(

Yes I am procrastinating, I'm supposed to be doing my [taxes](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/03/18/procrastination/).
