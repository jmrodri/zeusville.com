After doing agile development process for more than 6 months now, I'm not impressed. Maybe we're doing it wrong, but it just feels like it's process for the sake of process. I don't care for the daily scrum statuses, the tasking is annoying because I'm used to doing a lot of the little things on a project that no one ever wants to add to a schedule but need to get done. With agile I don't feel like I can do these because there are other tasks in the list that need to get done.

I prefer the old method of coming up with a list of features, specing and estimating them out, and moving forward. So what's different than agile? Well it has no daily status meetings and listing things in special agile software. We can use a wiki with a list of features and move along with writing the code.

Thanks for listening, I feel better now :) </rant>

PS this is NOT an April Fool's joke
