I was never really interested in blogging. Then one day I checked out Dave Johnson's blog. I was inspired. So here I am writing my first entry into my blog. On Monday, Sept 29th, my son, Adan, celebrated his second birthday. It is truly a joy to watch him grow unfortuntely, he's growing way too fast. He will grow even faster when our second son is born in the coming weeks (due Oct 21st). That's it for my first post. Stay tuned for more later.
