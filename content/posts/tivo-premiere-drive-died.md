On Wednesday night, the hard drive in my TiVo Premiere has died, stuck in a boot cycle. I ordered a new one from [Weaknees.com](https://www.weaknees.com/) should be here this week. We've been using the [Roku XD](http://www.roku.com/) to watch TV using the [Time Warner Cable app](http://www.roku.com/channels/#!details/23048/time-warner-cable). It's actually very usable and helps feed our addiction :) It's also a throw back to the old days of watching TV without a DVR (COMMERCIALS!). I'll let you know how the hard drive upgrade goes.
