Today Ad치n turns 3! I can't believe how fast time flies. I swear it was just yesterday he was taking a nap with me on the couch.

Ad치n has progressed nicely. He's been doing extremely well with the potty training he's almost fully indepedent with it. His speech has improved a lot in the past few weeks with full sentences instead of fragments.

For his birthday he got a guitar from Abuelo Paco, who past away last year. Ad치n loves it. And has thanked him for it in his prayers.

**Happy Birthday Ad치n**
