Our family Christmas holidays were great. We went to Maryland, on Thursday (12/23) night and got back to WARM North Carolina on Thursday (1/30). Going up was a decent drive not a lot of traffic and the boys slept since it was 10pm.

While in Maryland, we saw my parents, brother and his family, my in-laws, my sisters-in-law, Liz's cousins, two of my Aunts, and two of our friends. Ad√°n and Marco made out like bandits when Santa paid them a visit in Maryland.

All in all it was a great trip.
