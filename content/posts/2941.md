Sometimes I like to flip between the major cable news stations to see what they are all talking about during a specific time, usually after a big news event. Yesterday's news about the Manafort trial outcome and the surprising news about Cohen pleading guilty was important. This led me to do my news station flipping to see what folks were talking about this morning at 8 am. I was **NOT** surprised by what I found. The broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, NBC were all talking about the Cohen story during their morning shows, it was brief as they had more important things to get to like the weather or what celebrity was doing what :) The business news networks, CNBC, Fox Business, etc were all covering various business news. Some were talking about Snap CEO, Evan Spiegel. Others about what the market might do today. Pretty standard stuff, I wouldn't expect them to cover the Cohen story. The cable news networks were also as predictable. CNN was about to start what will ultimately become their day-long story about Cohen. ![IMG_20180822_080534](https://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/img_20180822_080534.jpg) MSNBC was covering the same Cohen story. ![IMG_20180822_080545](https://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/img_20180822_080545.jpg) And as you probably have guessed, Fox News was NOT talking about Cohen. It was focusing on brown people, specifically the fact that the murder suspect in the killing of Ms. Tibbetts, was an illegal alien. The story is horrifying and ABC News reported it with more compassion by stating that "the body of the missing girl was found" showing a picture of the girl as folks would want to remember her. The reporter did mention the killer was an illegal alien, but the focus of the story was on the tragic death. But not on Fox News, the illegal factor was the important piece: ![IMG_20180822_080524](https://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/img_20180822_080524.jpg) So I flipped through the channels a bit more, CNN and MSNBC were still talking about the Cohen case, this time getting "experts" in side by side panels. Totally par for the course in their reporting. I think they could probably move on to another story now that they've covered it, but whatever. Let's go back to Fox News, maybe now they'll talk about the Cohen case. Oh look they are talking about it. ![IMG_20180822_081109](https://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/img_20180822_081109.jpg) Well sort of, they're actually downplaying the entire thing because it wasn't directly about collusion. They were parroting the President that it is a "witch hunt" etc. They didn't spend much time on it either, which is okay. But they immediately went to Breaking News: ![IMG_20180822_081221](https://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/img_20180822_081221.jpg) Yep, news about more brown people committing crimes. Because the few times I do flip to Fox News, that's all they ever talk about. Apparently, I wasn't the only one that noticed this "phenomenon". The NY Times noticed it yesterday: [‘We Have Some Breaking News’: A Wild Day Makes Networks Scramble](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/business/media/cohen-manafort-cnn-foxnews-msnbc.html?rref=collection%2Fissuecollection%2Ftodays-new-york-times): https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/business/media/cohen-manafort-cnn-foxnews-msnbc.html?rref=collection%2Fissuecollection%2Ftodays-new-york-times   Now I know why I stopped watching cable news altogether. CNN & MSNBC repeat the same story ad nauseam while Fox News spreads fear. I'll stick to the world news in the evening, where they can give you the highlights without spending all day on them, and The Daily Show for my TV news. The rest of my news comes from newspapers.
