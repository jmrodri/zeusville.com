Moving the PS3 between different TVs, the HDMI didn't show any video output.

I had to reset the video output. Here's how you do it.

3.  Turn off the PS3.

6.  Plug in the HDMI cable to the PS3 and the TV.

9.  Remove the A/V multi-out composite cable from the PS3.

12.  Turn the TV on and switch it over to the HDMI input where the PS3 is plugged in.

15.  Press, and hold, the power button on the PS3 until you hear a 2nd beep. It will beep once when you initially press it, and a 2nd time shortly thereafter. Once you hear the 2nd beep you can remove your finger from the power button.

18.  The PS3 should handshake with the TV via HDMI and automatically select the appropriate resolutions.

You had found good trick. But, normally hdmi devices use a special option called EDID, this option let the devices set their supported maximum resolution automaticly. Nowadays, All brand HDTV models support EDID. Maybe your HDTV model doesn't support EDID !

It's not about the TV it's the PS3 output selection. This 'trick' is the way to force the PS3 to check its connection as it will just stay on its current one even if you physically chg the connection type.
