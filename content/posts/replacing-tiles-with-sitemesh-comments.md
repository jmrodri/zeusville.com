Please report your progress! I want to do this as well, with a couple of our struts/tiles apps. Seems like the right way to go.

I'll second Robert's comments above -- Please let us know how the migration goes. I am in the process of exploring a bunch of web-app frameworks for some new development and want to see how Sitemesh fits in. thanks
