So [Canon](http://www.canonusa.com) replied stating they don't have any Linux drivers, go figure.  I haven't bought a printer in almost 7 years and it still amazes me that companies STILL don't offer Linux drivers.  I mean [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html) and [ATI](http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html) sorta got it by offering drivers (though they still haven't released open source drivers though, but that's another topic).  So when will printer companies start offering drivers for Linux for all of their printers, even the low cost ones?
