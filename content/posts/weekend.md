Well, I had a great weekend. My parents came to visit Saturday. Adan was running Abuelo ragged. It's amazing the amount of energy that boy has.

Marco was feeling much better after a week with a high fever and a runny nose. Abuelo gave Marco his first "real" haircut (the first being only a trim of the longer hairs). Marco was very well behaved throughout the whole thing.

My parents stayed with the boys, while Liz & I went to Applebee's to have desert, drinks and some nice "childless" adult conversation :) Then we hit Wal-mart, which is open 24 hours, to walk around and kill some more time. It was a pretty nice evening.

Saturday afternoon, I took 2 hours to replace the rear brake pads and rotors on the Trans Am. I had done a brake job during the summer but only did the fronts. In the F-Body's the rear brakes do most of the stopping so they wear out twice as fast as the fronts. Partly because of they do most of the stopping but mostly because they're about half the size of the front pads.

It's now Monday, time to finish up what I left behind Friday night.
