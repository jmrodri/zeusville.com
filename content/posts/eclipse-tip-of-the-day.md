As more and more folks here use [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), I get more questions about it. So here are some tips I found useful:

#### Change Key mappings i.e. F3 for searching

1.  Click on Windows -> Preferences
2.  Open Workbench -> Keys
3.  In the Commands listbox, choose Edit -> Find Next
4.  Select the **Text Editor** entry in the Assigned key sequences: table
5.  In the dropdown box labled _Key sequence_ choose F3
6.  Click Add
7.  Click OK

Happy searching.
