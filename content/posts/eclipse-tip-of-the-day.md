As more and more folks here use [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), I get more questions about it. So here are some tips I found useful:

#### Change Key mappings i.e. F3 for searching

2.  Click on Windows -> Preferences
    
3.  Open Workbench -> Keys
    
4.  In the Commands listbox, choose Edit -> Find Next
    
5.  Select the **Text Editor** entry in the Assigned key sequences: table
    
6.  In the dropdown box labled _Key sequence_ choose F3
    
7.  Click Add
    
8.  Click OK
    

Happy searching.
