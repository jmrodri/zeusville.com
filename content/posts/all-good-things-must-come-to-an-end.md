It's unfortunate that today is Friday. It means that it is our last full day on the beach and tomorrow we have to go back home. It's been a great week being at the beach. This year we rented a great oceanfront beach house with a walkway directly to the beach. We got to hang out on our own private little paradise. Pictures and more to come once we get back home.
