I've spent several hours trying to get the Android Developer Toolkit version of eclipse to run on Fedora 20. It's constantly keeps dying with a segfault and libsoup.

```


\[13899.331278\] java\[15520\]: segfault at 0 ip 0000003929c70061 sp 00007fb66bd4df40 error 4 in libsoup-2.4.so.1.7.0\[3929c00000+a8000\]

I've tried all the workarounds on the net which suggest to make it use mozilla, so far no luck.

```


-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=mozilla

-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=/usr/lib64/xulrunner/

I even deleted my $HOME/.eclipse, that didn't work. I switched to a new workspace specifically for ADT. Again didn't help, still constantly dies.

UGH! Piece of Garbage. And to Ajay, no IntelliJ comments :)
