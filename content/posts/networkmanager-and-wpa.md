NetworkManager (0.7.0-0.6.7.svn3235) works with WPA security! That's great news because every time I visited my in-laws I had to use a wired connection. I have been wanting to change their wireless to use WEP so I could connect more easily, but I don't have to anymore. Kudos to the NetworkManager folks, you've made my laptop life that much easier.

This makes me wonder why we still have system-config-network /not/ supporting WPA.
