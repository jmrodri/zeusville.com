I wasn't as nerdy as I wanted to be. Oh well. Checkout the ["nerd test"](http://www.nerdtests.com/ft_nq.php).

Here's my score:

Score: 83. We probably both get a 5 point bonus for advertising our scores. And another 5 point for doing this on a Saturday night.

It's always hilarious to see how people react to their scores on most things. The Geek test \[just Google "Geek test" - it will appear as the first link\] is a LOT more accurate though. If I can get 100% on this test then I say it's too easy, but interesting nonetheless.
