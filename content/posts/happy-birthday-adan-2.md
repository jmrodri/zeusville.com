Since we were traveling on Adan's birthday, I didn't get a chance to make the obligatory birthday blog post. :) On September 29th, Adan turned **10**. I can't believe he's a decade old already. I told him 'you realize today is the last day you will be a single digit old'. It didn't seem to phase him.
