I'm not using Hibernate, but from what you write about your existing approach I think you could have an easier conversion to iBATIS SQL Maps (you could keep your existing SQL code mostly unchanged). You can find more about SQL Maps at: http://www.ibatis.com/common/sqlmaps.html The author is very responsive and development of new features has never stopped in the last 1.5 years (from when I started using it).
