Yes, you read it right. After buying the [Mazdaspeed3](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/2007-mazda-mazdaspeed3/), I don't see the need for keeping the Trans Am. A part of me wants to keep it and restore it, but the likelihood of me actually doing it are slim to none. The boys are still little 6 & 4. I'll be putting it up on eBay this week seems to be a market for not so good [1995 Pontiac Trans Ams](http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ih=001&sspagename=STRK%3AMEWA%3AIT&viewitem=&item=110234018791&rd=1).
