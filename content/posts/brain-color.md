**Your Brain is Blue**

![](http://images.blogthings.com/whatcolorisyourbrainquiz/blue.jpg)

Of all the brain types, yours is the most mellow.

You tend to be in a meditative state most of the time. You don't try to think away your troubles.

Your thoughts are realistic, fresh, and honest. You truly see things as how they are.You tend to spend a lot of time thinking about your friends, your surroundings, and your life.
