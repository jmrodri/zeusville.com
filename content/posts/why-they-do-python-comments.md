Computers don't often make me happy. Python simply makes me happy. :) -todd

For me, it's about developer-performance/maintainability balance. Let's call this arbitary stat D\*M, and IMHO it drives everything. Java is marketed as very strong at the "M", but is said to be readable "like a phone book" and trying to get real work done is awkward, so it gets a low score for "D". Ruby/Perl is marked as very strong at the "D", but tends to degenerate in the "M". Python finds a good balance, and comes out ahead. Not that I always agree with him (and where is Arc anyway), but see also: http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html Given, C is always in the running for heavy lifting reasons, with any of the above, and can not be forgotten.
