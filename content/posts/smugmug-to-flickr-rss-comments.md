just wanted to say that i have smugmug and love my flickr sidebar widget on my wordpress blog. i used the smugmug gallery feed (that i found on the Share page) and put it where the api feed thing was for flickr and it works. i just get the most recent pics, but for me that is enough. if my family wants more, they just click on the widget. this might work for other people like me who aren't very technical computer wise. :D
