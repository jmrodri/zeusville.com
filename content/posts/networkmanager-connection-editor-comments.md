I wonder if this ever hits version 1.0...

Yeah, ran into the same issue. Usability #fail!

Typical Gnome for ya. I switched to KDE because of the Shell Fiasco and do have easy access to the same dialog (but built in QT instead of GTK). Btw, there is a way to access that, IIRC. I remember using Gnome 3 for a few weeks and accidentally discovered how. Click on Network Settings, Then on Wireless, then when you select Networks, IIRC, there was an option called "Other" or something like that, that would open the dialog. I might be mistaken and my memory is playing tricks on me. I mostly remember blind rage during my Gnome 3 usage period.

That only works if you are ALREADY connected. Yeah, not great.

I had a similar problem and to edit the connections just as you do without using the terminal, I opened the Activities menu and typed "red" (network in Spanish) and it gave me 2 options. RED and CONEXIONES DE RED, Network and Network Connections. The second is the one that you needed.

"Thanks to Google, I was able to find a post that mentioned to use nm-connection-editor." Always read the errata! https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common\_F15\_bugs#networkmanager\_shell
