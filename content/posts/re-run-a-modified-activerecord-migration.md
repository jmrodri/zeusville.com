Rails has this cool feature called ActiveRecord Migration. It's an easy way to create and update your database. But if you get it wrong it is super annoying. This is where migrations and me loathe each other.

I had a migration which had the wrong column names. Now I could easily create another migration to change the names, but I'm still developing and I don't want yet another migration. First thing I did was modified the migration before rolling things back. That is definitely going to fail. SO I reverted my changes.

```


class AddRhevParams < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def change

    remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_params

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_hypervisor\_host\_id, :integer

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_engine\_host\_id, :integer

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_hypervisor, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_engine, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_database, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_cluster, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_storage, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_cpu, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_share, :string

  end

end

First I tried `rake db:rollback STEP=1` hoping that it would put the DB in the state prior to my latest migration. For whatever reason it failed with an IrreversableMigration error.

```


$ rake db:rollback STEP=1

The Apipie cache is turned off. Enable it and run apipie:cache rake task to speed up API calls.

Workaround for RbVmomi may not work as ComputeResource is already loaded: ComputeResource

\[deprecated\] I18n.enforce\_available\_locales will default to true in the future. If you really want to skip validation of your locale you can set I18n.enforce\_available\_locales = fal

se to avoid this message.

Tasks: TOP => db:migrate:down

Doing some googling, I found you can run `rails console` and run the migrations by hand, see [Executing Migration Commands From Rails Console](http://pmatsinopoulos.github.io/blog/2012/09/25/executing-migration-commands-from-rails-console/). 

I then ran these commands in my rails console:

```


ActiveRecord::Migration.remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_hypervisor\_host\_id

ActiveRecord::Migration.remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_engine\_host\_id

ActiveRecord::Migration.remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_hypervisor

ActiveRecord::Migration.remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_engine

ActiveRecord::Migration.remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_database

ActiveRecord::Migration.remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_cluster

ActiveRecord::Migration.remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_storage

ActiveRecord::Migration.remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_cpu

ActiveRecord::Migration.remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_share

ActiveRecord::Migration.add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_params, :text

Then I went into the database and deleted the reference to my migration from the `schema_migrations`.

```


=# delete from schema\_migrations where version = '20150216190947';

That cleaned up the migration and I was able to rerun using `rake db:migrate`

```


class AddRhevParams < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def change

    remove\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_params

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_hypervisor\_host\_id, :integer

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_engine\_host\_id, :integer

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_hypervisor\_hostname, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_engine\_hostname, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_database\_name, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_cluster\_name, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_storage\_name, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_storage\_type, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_storage\_address, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_cpu\_type, :string

    add\_column :fusor\_deployments, :rhev\_share\_path, :string

  end

end

So if you have trouble rolling things back automatically, you can try using `rails console` and mucking with the `schema_migrations` database table.
