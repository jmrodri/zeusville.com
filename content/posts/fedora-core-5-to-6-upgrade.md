After updating my laptop to FC6 GOLD, I got a taste of the Desktop Effects (compiz). It works extremely well on my Thinkpad with the ATI Radeon 7500. So I bit the bullet and upgraded my FC5 (x86\_64) install to FC6.

During the install I chose "upgrade existing installation". Since compiz was not in FC5, it did not get installed. So I had no "bling" by default. I found the rpm and installed it and it works great with my ATI X300 card.

Kudos to the Fedora team for putting out such a high quality distro.
