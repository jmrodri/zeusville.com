In order for BloGTK to actually publish your entry, you MUST check the "Publish Entry" box before clicking the Post Entry button. I think I'm going to suggest a Publish Entry button and a Post Entry button. Also, the Category dropdown doesn't get published when talking with [Roller](http://www.rollerweblogger.org/).
