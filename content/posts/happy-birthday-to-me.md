I know it's probably not cool to wish yourself happy birthday, but I'm not much for rules :) I opened my birthday presents this morning and was surprised to see some cool toys, yes they were toys I'm still a kid at heart. Here's what I got: A Logitech Driving Force™ GT wheel for the PS3, this will make it more fun to play Gran Turismo 5 Prologue. ![Logitech wheel](http://www.logitech.com/repository/659/jpg/6514.1.0.jpg) I finished [F.E.A.R.](http://ps3.ign.com/objects/848/848829.html) and really liked it so now I get to try the second version - F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin game for PS3 ![F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin](http://i43.tinypic.com/23tqkx5.jpg) I also got Motorstorm Pacific Rift to continue honing my racing skills :) ![Motorstorm](http://media.ign.com/games/image/object/965/965107/motorstorm_pacificrift_ESRBboxart_160w.jpg) The children got me some neat stuff too. Marco picked out Star Wars Commanders Battle pack Unleashed: ![](http://ep.yimg.com/ip/I/dragonballzcentral_2056_8529215411) Adan got me "The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor" DVD: ![The Mummy](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cdu83PeGL._SS500_.jpg) And finally, Iliana got me Star Wars [Neimoidian Shuttle diacast](http://www.toywiz.com/titaniumneimoidian.html) vehicle: ![](http://ep.yimg.com/ip/I/dragonballzcentral_2055_392639743) I've brought the Star Wars toys into the office to decorate my desk. I'll have to post pictures later. Now to enjoy the rest of my day.
