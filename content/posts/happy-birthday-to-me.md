I know it's probably not cool to wish yourself happy birthday, but I'm not much for rules :)

I opened my birthday presents this morning and was surprised to see some cool toys, yes they were toys I'm still a kid at heart. Here's what I got:

A Logitech Driving Forceâ„¢ GT wheel for the PS3, this will make it more fun to play Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

I finished [F.E.A.R.](http://ps3.ign.com/objects/848/848829.html) and really liked it so now I get to try the second version - F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin game for PS3

I also got Motorstorm Pacific Rift to continue honing my racing skills :)

The children got me some neat stuff too. Marco picked out Star Wars Commanders Battle pack Unleashed:

I've brought the Star Wars toys into the office to decorate my desk. I'll have to post pictures later.

Now to enjoy the rest of my day.
