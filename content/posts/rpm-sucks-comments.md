For 'queries' against the rpm database, you need to know the following:  
  

*   if it's a file, use p
*   If it's a package, don't

  
So if you have bob-2.3.i386.rpm and you want to know what files it includes, you type "rpm -qpl bob-2.3.i386.rpm". Once it installs you only need to say "rpm -ql bob". Not that hard really.

Why don't you use urpmi? It's a million times better.
