I am upgrading an old sw product that is running Fedora 6. I am trying to reproduce the development environment, so I am left hunting for various development packages. I need to get the exact versions that were used for the origional software, but Fedora / RedHat 's archive site has very few packages for FC6. Have you found a archive site that has all the old development packages for FC6? Thanks in advance.
