Since I can remember I have always loved cars. I'm not sure what it is but I have a deep interest in them. I guess it must have started when I was young because I still remember most of the cars my family owned. Here's a list in the order I remembered them :)

*   1968 [Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Vista_Cruiser) wagon (white) - "Betsy"
*   1977 [Pontiac Ventura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_Ventura) (burgundy)
*   1984 [Buick Skyhawk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick_Skyhawk) wagon (blue)
*   1971 [Dodge Dart Swinger 2-doo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Dart)r (blue with white top)
*   Subaru (orange, 2 cylinders)
*   [Dodge Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Dynasty) (devil car)
*   1977 [Dodge Aspen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Aspen) (silver)
*   Chevy van (blue, I remember the accident we had in the ice)
*   1988 [Jeep Cherokee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_Cherokee_%28XJ%29)
*   1989 [Lincoln Continental](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Continental#1988_-_1994) (blue)
*   [Jeep Liberty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_Liberty) (silver, currently owned)
*   [Honda Accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord#Sixth_generation_.281998.E2.80.932002.29) (green, currently owned)
*   [Ford Fairmont](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Fairmont)
*   [1996 Pontiac Grand Prix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_Grand_Prix#1996) (saw this get stolen)

Out of all the cars my parents have owned I liked the 1968 Oldsmobile. In fact I wouldn't mind owning one of those today.
