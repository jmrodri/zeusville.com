Lot's of folks complain that the south doesn't know how to deal with snow. We don't know how to drive in it. We don't know how to work in it. We don't have snow trucks, well not many and most are in the mountains. But we do know how to get rid of the snow, we let the Sun take care of it :) This morning at 9 am both the front and backyard had plenty of snow covering it.
