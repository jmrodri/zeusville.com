A [month ago](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/tivo-saga-fixed-for-now/) our [tuning adapter](http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/133) got messed up in a storm. This week another storm came in and knocked out the power just long enough to reboot all the electronics in the house, with an average boot time of 6 minutes and fear of pissing off the tuning adapter, I put the [TiVo](http://www.tivo.com) and the tuning adapter on a UPS. The same storm annoyed my network equipment upstairs: Toshiba PCX1100U cable modem, Linksys WRT54G wireless router, Motorola VT1005 Vonage adapter and D-Link gigabit switch. So I ordered a UPS for them as well. I might add the server to the UPS as well but really it's not that important that it stay up during a power outage.
