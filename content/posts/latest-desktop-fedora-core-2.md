As I stated earlier, I like to troll some of the gnome websites looking for new icons & themes.  
Here's a thumbnail of my current desktop (click to enlarge): [![](http://jroller.com/resources/jmrodri/20041106_desktop_preview.png)](http://zeusville.homeip.net/20041106_desktop.png)

I'm using the [OpusOS](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=14092) metacity theme, which gives me the nice blue border around the windows. I find it to be clean and not very gaudy.

When I first applied it, it did not look as smooth as the one in the preview. Turns out I needed to install the Smooth theme engine, which can be found at [sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/smooth-engine/). Once the engine was installed that gave me the sleek and smooth menus.![](http://jroller.com/resources/jmrodri/firefox_menu.png)

In Fedora, the GNOME menu is as the bottom of the screen, in other distributions the put a small GNOME menu at the top of the screen. As you can see in my desktop preview, I put a small (24 pixel) menu at the top of the screen, then added another 64 pixel menu to the left with all of the main applications.

The icons I'm using is [GNANT](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=15764), which I modified to extend [GnoMetal](http://www.aquaxp.com/strestout1/). I like the GnoMetal icons for the web browser, email, and OpenOffice (they are the top 5 icons on the taskbar above). Here's a sampling of the GNANT icons as seen in Nautilus
