I think I've found a new show to watch to fill the void left by the departure of ["The OC"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_O.C.) which filled the void left by ["Beverly Hills, 90210"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills_90210), that show is called ["Hidden Palms"](http://www.cwtv.com/shows/hidden-palms)  As you can see I like cheesy television.  I'm not sure why I like these type of shows, maybe it's reliving my youth or simply because I just like bad television :)
