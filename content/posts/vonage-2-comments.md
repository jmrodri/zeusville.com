Interesting. Now you got me scared. I just signed up for Lingo which is a more economical Vonage clone. I got my hardware last Friday but I can't hook it up until I pick up my cable modem today. I hope I don't have similar issues. Let me know how everything works out.

I use the Vonage phone adapter behind my router. Works fine, though I do limit my bandwith usage when on the phone for better phone quality.
