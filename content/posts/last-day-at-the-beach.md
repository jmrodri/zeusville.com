We got up extra early this morning to load up the van and checkout from our beach house.  We hit a little traffic on the way home but not as bad as the traffic we hit when we travel to Maryland, we go home around 1:15pm today. On the way home we stopped by Waffle House for breakfast. I forgot how much of a hell hole those places are, but it was better than eating McDonald's. Tonight we ended the evening with dinner at Milton's Pizza, thanks Jacquie!
