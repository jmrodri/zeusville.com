As President of the United States, George W. Bush, a man of received wisdom,
has a large history from which to receive wisdom. But, he chooses to ignore it.
As Kennedy states here, in order to be a great leader one must also learn.

President Bush claims that the best way to combat terrorism is to spread
freedom. However, instead of spreading freedom through peace he chooses to
spread it through war.

> "Mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind."

There will always be war because there will always be people involved. That
statement just proves he is not all wise and was directed to a different
historical moment.
