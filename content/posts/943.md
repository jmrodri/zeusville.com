On Wednesday I went to visit Adan's [technology class](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/939/). I let them play with the XO when we got home which they really enjoyed. \[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYk58PiO61E\]
Adan and Marco play with the OLPC XO laptop. They had a good time with it. You can get one here: [http://www.amazon.com/xo](http://www.amazon.com/xo)

Talking to you kids while they're trying to play the game is just wrong :) I think I really gotta get at least one XO for my boys.
