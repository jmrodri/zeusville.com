One of the things I dislike about Java are having to write getters and setters. In this discussion on [Sun's Developer Forum](http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?forumID=31&threadID=280669), someone was wanting to know how to auto generate getters and setters. They seem to frustrate a few folks to the point where some want to ignore them altogether:

While I find not using getters and setters a bit extreme, I don't like the fact that I need an IDE to auto generate getters and setters. What would really be nice is if Java could "just know" when it finds a member variable at runtime with no getter/setter, it's implied. It's a lot like the default constructor behaves.

For example, it should suffice to be able to write the following User class, and be able to call it's getters and setters.

`public class User {`

`private String name;`

`private int age;`

`}`

Then I can say:

`User u = new User();`

`u.setName("fname lname");`

`assertEquals("fname lname", u.getName());`

If I want to override the default functionality of Java, then I can create the getter or setter like I do today.
