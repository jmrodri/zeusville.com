Since my A/C busted in my car again this year, I've been interested in the weather. Particularly the relationship between [temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature), [humidity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity), and [dewpoint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewpoint) . Turns out that you want the dewpoint to stay constant while the temperature rises, which means the humidity is going down. The forecast for today was a relative humidity of 67% and temperature of 85 degrees [F](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit). `-- Weather Underground Match -- visibility_kilometers = 16.1 wind_kilometersperhour = 8.7 dewpoint_fahrenheit = 47 temperature_fahrenheit = 75.6 moonphase = Waning Gibbous moonset = 7:51 AM EDT temperature_celsius = 24.2 celsius = 24.2 pressure = 29.53 in 999.9 hPa (Steady) updated = 10:07 AM EDT on July 02, 2007 conditions = Mostly Cloudy sunrise = 6:02 AM EDT visibility_miles = 10.0 humidity = 36 dewpoint_celsius = 8 clouds = (FEW) : 15000 ft 4572 m Mostly Cloudy (BKN) : 25000 ft 7620 m moonrise = 10:31 PM EDT wind_milesperhour = 5.4 fahrenheit = 75.6 wind_direction = NE place = Tree Haven, Apex, North Carolina sunset = 8:34 PM EDT`
