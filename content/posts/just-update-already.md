I've grown tired of these stupid 'waiting' messages. Time to find a remedy.

```


$ sudo yum list updates

Loaded plugins: allowdowngrade, changelog, fastestmirror, priorities, refresh-

              : packagekit

Existing lock /var/run/yum.pid: another copy is running as pid 7292.

Another app is currently holding the yum lock; waiting for it to exit...

yum-updatesd you are dead to me now. This is the last time you bother poor little yum :)

```


$ sudo kill 7292

$ sudo yum remove yum-updatesd

...

Removed:

  yum-updatesd.noarch 1:0.9-1.fc9

Complete!

" @bochecha: yum-updatesd has been present on every Fedora 10 install I have done. " Comps doesn't indicate it being installed by default.

That is the first thing I do after an install.

Wait, yum-updatesd ? Wasn't it replaced by the PackageKit daemon ? I think I haven't heard of yum-updatesd on my system since Fedora 10, it wasn't installed by default here... Also, the yum messages are quite different with latest versions... Are you stil on Fedora 9 ? If so, you might really want to upgrade. PackageKit works in a different way. You don't have a daemon blocking you for such a long time. And when it does block you (usually just after a previous yum operation), it does so for a very short time.
