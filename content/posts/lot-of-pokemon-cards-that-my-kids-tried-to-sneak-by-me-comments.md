Omg, What idiots! Ok, first off, I do feel lkind of bad for the mom, but shouldn't she just leave to oldest ones home (unless they are only, like, 7) and have the others at a friends house or being babysat? That would make things easier. Why is the grocery store even selling pokemon cards? Why is everyone here asking for them, you dont have any to sell! I wish I could have them, but recognize that you dont have them. Something confused me. Why in the world does she say that after her daughter rammed into her ankles, they had to be amputated? Doesn't that seem a little unlikely to you? It does to me. That is the first thing that makes this seem fake. Like, Wat? So yeah, that's all I can think of. Geez! That's crazy! ~Me P.S. I would totally sneak pokemon cards if i were me!! But wait until i was home, sneak them to my room and open them. You can also tell the mom has no idea about pokemon cards at all.
