Last night was the debate between the two vice-presidential candidates, Joe Biden (Democrat) and Sarah Palin (Republican). Read the [debate transcript](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/).

What amazed me was the GOP pundits after the debate and how they tried to say that Palin won the debate, gleaming at how well she did. Um, were they watching the same debate I was watching? It was almost painful to listen to her speak. The entire time I watched the debate, I thought Sarah sounded like [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj3iNxZ8Dww). (click link)

Now let's look at what she said, or didn't say:

**Palin**:

> You know, I think a good barometer here, as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America's economy, is go to a kid's soccer game on Saturday, and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, "How are you feeling about the economy?"
> 
> And I'll bet you, you're going to hear some fear in that parent's voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market. Did we just take a major hit with those investments?
> 
> Fear about, how are we going to afford to send our kids to college? A fear, as small-business owners, perhaps, how we're going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people.
> 
> The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end.

And precisely **HOW** do you plan on fixing that economy? And as Biden said:

> it was two Mondays ago John McCain said at 9 o'clock in the morning that the fundamentals of the economy were strong. Two weeks before that, he said George -- we've made great economic progress under George Bush's policies.

Which McCain back peddled when he had to explain what he meant by "fundamentals", as Palin pointed out:

> John McCain, in referring to the fundamental of our economy being strong, he was talking to and he was talking about the American workforce.

But McCain has always said he knows a lot less about economics than military affairs: [see for yourself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1X3efvVTLA&NR=1) (click link).

Palin again comments about lenders and corruption:

> Darn right it was the predator lenders, who tried to talk Americans into thinking that it was smart to buy a $300,000 house if we could only afford a $100,000 house. There was deception there, and there was greed and there is corruption on Wall Street. And we need to stop that.
> 
> Again, John McCain and I, that commitment that we have made, and we're going to follow through on that, getting rid of that corruption.
> 
> One thing that Americans do at this time, also, though, is let's commit ourselves just every day American people, Joe Six Pack, hockey moms across the nation, I think we need to band together and say never again. Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing our money and loaning us these dollars. We need to make sure that we demand from the federal government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments and our savings and we need also to not get ourselves in debt. Let's do what our parents told us before we probably even got that first credit card. Don't live outside of our means. We need to make sure that as individuals we're taking personal responsibility through all of this. It's not the American peoples fault that the economy is hurting like it is, but we have an opportunity to learn a heck of a lot of good lessons through this and say never again will we be taken advantage of.

And HOW are you doing to do that? [Obama/Biden](http://www.barackobama.com/index.php) will do it with regulation.

When Biden tries to call her out on it,

> the governor did not answer the question about deregulation, did not answer the question of defending John McCain about not going along with the deregulation, letting Wall Street run wild. He did support deregulation almost across the board. That's why we got into so much trouble.

Palin still dodges the question:

> I'm still on the tax thing because I want to correct you on that again. And I want to let you know what I did as a mayor and as a governor. And I may not answer the questions that either the moderator or you want to hear, but I'm going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also. As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes. I eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax. We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up. Now, as for John McCain's adherence to rules and regulations and pushing for even harder and tougher regulations, that is another thing that he is known for though. Look at the tobacco industry. Look at campaign finance reform.

Again, HUH? What the hell are you talking about woman?

Now they move on to healthcare, and McCain's plan is just "**darn**_" <------ that's in honor of Palin._

> I am because he's got a good health care plan that is detailed. And I want to give you a couple details on that. He's proposing a $5,000 tax credit for families so that they can get out there and they can purchase their own health care coverage. That's a smart thing to do. That's budget neutral. That doesn't cost the government anything as opposed to Barack Obama's plan to mandate health care coverage and have universal government run program and unless you're pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately, I don't think that it's going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the feds. But a $5,000 health care credit through our income tax that's budget neutral. That's going to help. And he also wants to erase those artificial lines between states so that through competition, we can cross state lines and if there's a better plan offered somewhere else, we would be able to purchase that. So affordability and accessibility will be the keys there with that $5,000 tax credit also being offered.

Ok let's go to John McCain's [website](http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/19ba2f1c-c03f-4ac2-8cd5-5cf2edb527cf.htm) for more information on that.

> John McCain Will Reform The Tax Code To Offer More Choices Beyond Employer-Based Health Insurance Coverage. While still having the option of employer-based coverage, every family will receive a direct refundable tax credit - effectively cash - of $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families to offset the cost of insurance. Families will be able to choose the insurance provider that suits them best and the money would be sent directly to the insurance provider. Those obtaining innovative insurance that costs less than the credit can deposit the remainder in expanded Health Savings Accounts.

So if you are using employer supplied health care, you don't get anything to help offset the costs. So this $5,000 is only for those that choose to not use employer supplied health care. What he doesn't say is he will tax those that use employer health benefits, like **ME**!

See [factcheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/mccains_5000_promise.html):

> Those with employer-sponsored coverage, however, also might want to know that under McCain's plan, they will pay taxes on the value of health care benefits they receive from their employers. It's not that families will receive a windfall of $5,000, but that the credit will more or less offset the increased taxes they'll pay.

When Palin was asked about taking anything off of the plate because of the economic issue, we see that she hasn't been doing this political stuff for very long:

> There is not. And how long have I been at this, like five weeks? So there hasn't been a whole lot that I've promised, except to do what is right for the American people, put government back on the side of the American people, stop the greed and corruption on Wall Street.
> 
> And the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving. And I don't believe that John McCain has made any promise that he would not be able to keep, either.

**FIVE** weeks? Great that's precisely who I want to be Vice-President. Oh wait, did you see what else she said? Look again:

> And the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving

Is that REGULATION? I thought she was against government sponsored regulation?

When Biden charges the McCain camp about their bankruptcy policy:

> Number two, with regard to bankruptcy now, Gwen, what we should be doing now -- and Barack Obama and I support it -- we should be allowing bankruptcy courts to be able to re-adjust not just the interest rate you're paying on your mortgage to be able to stay in your home, but be able to adjust the principal that you owe, the principal that you owe.
> 
> That would keep people in their homes, actually help banks by keeping it from going under. But John McCain, as I understand it -- I'm not sure of this, but I believe John McCain and the governor don't support that.
> 
> There are ways to help people now. And there -- ways that we're offering are not being supported by -- by the Bush administration nor do I believe by John McCain and Gov. Palin.

Palin completely dodges the question:

> That is not so, but because that's just a quick answer, I want to talk about, again, my record on energy versus your ticket's energy ticket, also.

Let me translate that for you:

> "That is not so, but because that's just a quick answer, _I want to talk about, something I know about other than the real issue because then I'd look stupid or like that Teen Miss America from South, um, oh you know, South, McClellan._"

I really could go on for quite some time doing this, but I'm outta time. I urge you to go read the full transcript if you didn't see the debate, heck, read it even if you did see it:
