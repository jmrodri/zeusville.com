Almost all newer phones don't support USB storage now because it's really hard to manage the access. On F18 using Gnome, my Nexus 4 automounts and shows up in the file manager without me doing anything. It's certainly possible that at some point I installed an extra package that made it work, but I didn't have to do anything special beyond that.
