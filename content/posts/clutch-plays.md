Tonight, Adan had his first baseball game of the season. His team was down 4-3 in the last inning (top of the hour). Adan gets his first hit of the night (1-2) which he turns into a double. His team mate gets a hit, the other team throws the ball away. Adan (ignoring the third base coach) heads home to tie the game at 4-4. Adan's team brings in 2 more runs to **win** 6-4.

After the game, Coach gave Adan the game ball for starting the game winning rally. **YAY**! :)
