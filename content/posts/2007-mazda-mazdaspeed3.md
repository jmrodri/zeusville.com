Tonight I bought a used 2007 Mazda [Mazdaspeed3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazdaspeed_3). I finally got the last bit of life out of my 1995 Pontiac Trans Am, 12 years for an American car is great, in my opinion. But then again the one thing American car makers do well is make good V-8's (not the juice) and it probably would've been fine a bit longer if I didn't have the [accident](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2004/12/22/there-is-a-god/) [back in 2004](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2005/01/02/car-update/).

The Mazda has both performance and practicality, the latter is something the [Trans Am](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jmrodri/460957330/) had none of. I haven't driven a different stick shift in a long time so it took a bit of getting used to the Mazdaspeed's clutch and brakes, very touchy and it moves too.

Here are some pictures (I took them from the dealer's website):

For more pictures check out my flickr set: [2007 Mazdaspeed3](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jmrodri/sets/72157604183175449/). Ok off to go read the manual to see what all the things can do. Yes I read car manuals, there are a lot of little jewels you can find in them sometimes features you didn't know the car had.

Nice car. Looks like we are snagging a 1999 VW GTI for $4700 shortly (85K miles). Bought it through family. Not... your 2007 Speed 3, but... :) /me likes cars under 5K. :) -todd

The TransAm only lasted that long because you drove it easy!

Looks like your might actually fit in the new car. If the TransAm did not have T tops you would have been way too tall!

Nice ride... I had a Miata for 11 years and loved it to death (literally). I chose a Honda Civic Si as my replacement and enjoy it immensely. But for a hot hatchback, the numbers don't compare to the Mazdaspeed3. Let us know how it goes...

Very cool, good for you!! I am extremely jealous because my poor '92 Honda Accord is pretty much TOAST. I'm thinking I'll have to send her to the junkyard, but maybe I can at least donate it ... I definitely got a lot of miles out of her, at least. :'-(

\[...\] sinuses. We got home around 2:45pm today, but the ride home was less than fun for her. We drover my car to the hospital, and the suspension being to taut made every bump, ditch, or even minor road \[...\]
