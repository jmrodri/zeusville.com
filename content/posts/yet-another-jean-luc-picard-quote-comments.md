If you truly live by this you can never sit by the TV and just relax being bored. All this "Live every moment" phrases freak me out, if I just start to think about them instead of just swallowing them. Time is not just passing, it is also coming ... time actually does not exist at all, it lives behind you and in front of you but it is never where you are right at the moment. So, even saying "Time is" actually is a lie or an illusion. It's just a non-existent something the clockmakers in switzerland invented to haunt us all our lifes...some big invisible spook haunting you. Ironically, thinking about time is therefore probably the most-interesting waste of time of all times...to end this, what we leave behind I think is the only way to trick and overcome time, because when we leave behind then we create something that goes beyond our own little share of time we have been granted, something that lives on after our time is over. If you do not leave behind anything, time might just haunt you again on your very last minute on the death bed, this time from behind, I guess it's called the past. ... I guess I needa write a blog entry, maybe ... it's getting too long here, too much time to read, too much time wasted - I needa cherish those moments more instead of writing time:)
