Last week, Adán mentioned that some of his classmates go to work with their parents while they are tracked out from school. I ask him "so would you like to do that?" He replied excitedly "YEAH!"

Today, Adán, my 6 year old son, went to work with me for the **entire** day. First thing he realized was "it takes a long time to get to your work", as my commute is about 35-45 minutes each way depending on time and traffic. When we got to work, we promptly got him a visitor's badge, made a breakfast pitstop to pick up a bagel and a rice krispies treat (his choice). He ate about 3/4 of it, and half a bagel. Oh and he got orange juice, his favorite juice. He spent the morning playing on nickjr.com, drawing & coloring.

For lunch, we walked over to Rockola but it was closed when we got there. Closed as in no one works there anymore, not as in come back later. So we settled for Burger King which was a hit with Adán because he got crown shaped chicken nuggets and a toy. The best part was when we crossed the road which is a 4 lane with a turn lane. We crossed the first 2 lanes and stopped in the middle turn lane to allow the other 4 cars to pass us, before continuing crossing. When we got across Adán said "you almost killed me. I'm going to tell mommy you almost killed me." I burst out laughing because he was serious.

After lunch, Adán continued to draw, color, and play on the computer. We took a walk at 3:00 pm down to [Lake Raleigh](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1801+varsity+drive+raleigh,+nc&sll=35.966635,-78.511276&sspn=0.011566,0.022659&ie=UTF8&ll=35.765266,-78.679469&spn=0.011596,0.022659&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr) where we saw some folks fishing. We then returned back to the office to finish up our day. Needless to say, he was wore out.

It was one of the best days at work I've ever had EVER!

Good post dude. For those of us terrified of parenthood it's good to see it's not all horrifying. :) I am however a little disappointed you didn't get him doing any stage bug verification.
