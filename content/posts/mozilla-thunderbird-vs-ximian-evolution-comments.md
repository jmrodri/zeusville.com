What was your "hack" for importing Evo mail into Thunderbird? Just curious.

actually Thunderbird imports from Eudora, OE, Outlook and Netscape. The trouble is that it cannot import from plain old mbox format even if it is its internal format :-(

Like Marty, I would also like to know the hack because I would like to change from Evolution to Thunderbird. If you have the time, pop me an e-mail, thanks.

I'd also love to hear how you imported mail from Evolution to Thunderbird. I'm thinking of switching over to Thunderbird, which is at 0.6 at the moment. Thanks!
