I got a new book today [Better, Faster, Lighter Java](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596006764/qid=1088734889/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-9535648-5135824?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) by Bruce A. Tate & Justin Gehtland.

Bruce gave a great talk on [Spring](http://www.springframework.org/) and a few on [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org). This book looks very interesting and enlightening. I've already had the opinion that EJBs were overkill for most web applications and that folks choose technologies because they are the latest craze not because they are the best technical solutions to a problem.

I'll let everyone know how the book is.
