Web versions exist. I used web version of TurboTax last year -- worked great.

I second the Web versions. I always use the web versions through my bank. Plus, it keeps all my past data no matter what I do to my PC.

Personally, I don't trust the web version. I prefer native software. But I wouldn't be opposed to installing a web version on my machine. That would be interesting.

You know, the pen & paper method of doing taxes isn't too bad either.
