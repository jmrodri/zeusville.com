\[...\] JRoller to WordPress migration I really got annoyed with the JRoller interface after they decided to upgrade to a newer version. It was not that user friendly anymore so decided to migrate to wordpress which is much much better. Naturally I wanted to migrate my blog entries from JRoller to wordpress but JRoller doesnt provide any export options. Googling for the topic returned an entry titled JRoller to Wordpress migration. \[...\]

**There goes the neighborhood…** I brought over some of my jroller entries; couldn’t get them all, but oh well… I found this wonderful blog telling me how to create a template that can be used to export some of the entries as an RSS XML document. This document is then imp...

Thanks for the tips. It really helped me. I was wondering why it only showed 15 entries, even though my blog had around 32. I then set the maximum displayed t o 30 (under settings - it wouldn't allow me to set beyond this) and got 30 entries successfully ported.

I won't be using JRoller anymore after I kept getting a site offline messages for over a number of important occasions when I needed it. Wordpress rocks!

Hi I am migrating to my personal WordPress blog. Is there a way to get more than 30 entries in the wpexport.xml? Can you parameterise the URL query or the template? It is really frustrating that Jroller blog has no export blog entry features. It will make me think twice before investing in a blogging platform. I will probably have to get the Roller Manual and look explicitly for velocity templates. Ahh!!! Thanks in advance
