Since we left before Christmas, we wanted the boys to think there is a Santa. So before we left, Liz loaded the presents under the tree. When we got back on January 30th, Ad√°n was so excited to see that Santa had visited our home in North Carolina. It was truly magical.

I've also come up with the answer to "is Santa real" question. My answer is that Santa and the Christmas spirit lives inside each of our hearts.
