I had an [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com) gift certificate and decided to use it to purchase a 4 **internal** port [SATA II controller.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018TCB36) Amazon.com had one at a reasonable price fulfilled through a reseller, Eforcity.com. My first red flag should've been that it was not being shipped from Amazon themselves. Secondly, it was not eligible from [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/subs/primeclub/signup/main.html/ref=amb_link_6875622_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=auto-sparkle&pf_rd_r=0V203J7Q8VFJH8MQZA9X&pf_rd_t=301&pf_rd_p=397776501&pf_rd_i=amazon%20prime). But I wanted to make use of my gift certificate and proceed with the order. They shipped the card on 7/26/08 and on 7/30/08 I opened the package to find a SATA II controller with 2 **internal** ports and 2 **external** ports. This is the WRONG card and the box was clearly marked with a sticker that said 2 external and 2 internal. ARGH! I contact them via email 3 times! Finally I contact Amazon customer support which promptly kicked Eforcity into responding. On 8/1/08, they finally send me a return shipping label, and I return the card on 8/2/08. Today, I finally received my replacement only 16 days after I got the first shipment. And what did these morons do? send me the same freaking card. The box again stated 2 external and 2 internal ports, but the shrinkwrap had a sticker on it stating it was the 4 **internal** port version. I open it to verify, nope it's still the 2 **external** and 2 **internal**. ARGH! I mean is it really that hard to fulfull a damn order correctly? Especially when someone returns an item? I'm now trying to get it returned for a full refund. Wish me luck with that. What have I learned from this? A few things:

*   don't buy stuff from Amazon unless it comes directly from them
*   avoid Eforcity.com at all costs
*   when it comes to computer parts stick with [Newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com)

Today, I went with old faithful, [Newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com).
