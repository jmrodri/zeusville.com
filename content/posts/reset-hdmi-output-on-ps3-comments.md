You had found good trick. But, normally hdmi devices use a special option called EDID, this option let the devices set their supported maximum resolution automaticly. Nowadays, All brand HDTV models support EDID. Maybe your HDTV model doesn't support EDID !

It's not about the TV it's the PS3 output selection. This 'trick' is the way to force the PS3 to check its connection as it will just stay on its current one even if you physically chg the connection type.
