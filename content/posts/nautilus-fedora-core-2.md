So far I'm loving the new "spatial" navigation in Nautilus. It reminds me a lot of the OS/2 days.

My only gripe is with the default association of java files to a java compiler. I will figure out how to change this tomorrow night, but 99% of the time when I double click a java file I want to open it. The 1% of the time I want to compile it, I have a script or IDE to do it since most files need to be compiled in context with other files.
