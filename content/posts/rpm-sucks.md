[rpm](http://www.rpm.org) is definitely the worst package manager out there. It's way to difficult to use. For instance, given a rpm how do you list the files in it?

I tried

```
rpm --list --file my.rpm
```I simply get the rpm help screen again. Hmmm, I guess it's time to type```
rpm --help
```I search for --list and find that you must specify --query and --package. Ok that makes sense. So I type in```
rpm -qlp my.rpm
```. Ah so package is different than file.

For 'queries' against the rpm database, you need to know the following:  
  

*   if it's a file, use p
*   If it's a package, don't

  
So if you have bob-2.3.i386.rpm and you want to know what files it includes, you type "rpm -qpl bob-2.3.i386.rpm". Once it installs you only need to say "rpm -ql bob". Not that hard really.

Why don't you use urpmi? It's a million times better.
