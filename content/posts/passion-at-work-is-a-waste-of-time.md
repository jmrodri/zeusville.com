It's a shame that it has come to this point, but having passion at work is a waste of time and energy.  I guess it's now time for greener pastures.

you mean passion at \*this\* job is a waste of time or passion at work in general? i think passion is pretty important. helps a lot with being happy. but if it gets you nowhere, time to move on to something else... problem i've always found is where do i think it'd be better? only thing i've thought of is working for myself :-)
