Today Adán & I went to the [Durham Bulls](http://www.durhambulls.com/) game to start our annual ritual. The Bulls beat the Columbus Clippers [5-2](http://www.durhambulls.com/cgi-bin/schedule/gamePage.pl?gameID=423&action=post). The weather couldn't have been more perfect it was a balmy 78 degree day with low humidity.

Adán had a great time. He was cheering and yelling at the batters to "Hit ball". He's a baseball enthusiast at the tender age of 2 and a half years.![](http://www.durhambulls.com/images/woolebulls/woole_6.jpg)

My Dad took us to many sporting events in Maryland. We saw many [Orioles](http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/index.jsp?c_id=bal) games during the summers. The one thing I always remember him saying was that he always wanted to take me to the Washington [Senators](http://www.cjis.com/senators.htm) baseball games, but they moved the year I was born 1971. So now that I have two boys of my own, I started taken Adán and Marco before they were 1 to see our local baseball team The Durham Bulls. The games are cheap and enjoyable. Easy to get in and out, and there's not a bad [seat](http://www.durhambulls.com/tickets/seating_map.html) in the house.
