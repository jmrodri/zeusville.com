I ordered Liz a new phone today. Her old Virgin Mobile phone was out dated and we were spending quite a bit of change lately on that plan. After much going back and forth on whether to switch us both to [AT&T Wireless](http://www.attwireless.com) or to just add her to my existing [Verizon Wireless](http://www.verizonwireless.com) plan, based on who we call it made more sense to stay with Verizon. What did she get? an LG env3 in Slate Blue, and it should be here tomorrow.
