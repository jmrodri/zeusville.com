The most recent thing I've found annoying is with the Bush

administrations so called energy policy. Here's a portion of his Energy

policy (source: [Bush' Energy Plan](http://www.georgewbush.com/Record/Energy.aspx)).

Increase Domestic Energy Supplies and Protect the Environment

Instead of looking for alternatives, they want to keep

us dependent on fossil fuels, which makes sense since

that's where the Bush-Cheney families make their money.

The other thing they don't understand is economics.

The reason we buy oil from foreign sources is NOT because

we can't make it here, it's price. It's cheaper to produce

oil in the Middle East that it is here in the US. Both in

terms of labor costs as well as the fact that it just seeps

out of the ground in the Middle East as opposed to the

layers of rock we must drill with here.

Ethanol & biodiesel are corn based which he uses to get

the farm vote. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing,

though I would put more emphasis on this than trying to

drill for more oil.

Again, still harping on "domestic oil".

Natural Gas is good. But "simplify the permit process"?

Does that mean allow anyone to destroy the environment

to build a pipeline? I want cheap gas and clean natural

gas as well, but not at the expense of the environment.

Again with the fossil fuels. The Federal lands being

targeted are national forests. Not to mention the fact

that Tribal lands are the Indian reservations. How much

more do we have to do to the Native Americans of this

country?

Now this is probably the ONLY thing that makes sense.

We do have to preserve our Strategic Petroleum Reserve,

but we should be looking for ways to get OFF of petroleum

to avoid the NEED for the SPR.

That's just a small sampling of his so called Energy policy. I'm tired

now, I could go on for days about the moronic messages coming from the

current administration.
