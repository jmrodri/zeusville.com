It took a bit of work, but I got mkdir to create a new category (album) on [smugmug](http://www.smugmug.com). I mounted my [zmugfs](http://sm-photo-tool.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sm-photo-tool/trunk/zmugfs/src/zmugfs.py?revision=48&view=markup) on /tmp/fuse. I ran the following commands: ![commands](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/commands.png) And they showed up in [smugmug](http://www.smugmug.com). Still a lot of bugs, but I'm happy with the progress. ![albums inÂ smugmug](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/mkdir.png)
