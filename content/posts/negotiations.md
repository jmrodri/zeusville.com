Usually the boys try to negotiate how much they have to eat before being excused.Â  Sometimes they've eaten most of their dinner and it's just a matter of eating one or two bites. Tonight, Marco didn't eat hardly anything, while Adan had already eaten two servings. So Marco starts his negotiations, here's how it played out:

Marco: "How many bites do I have to take? one?"

Liz: "Um, it's more like ten."

Marco: "No, two?"

Me: "How about eleven?"

Marco: "Ok"

And he ate eleven bites :)
