Getting a nice dark theme on a Linux desktop is probably one of the most difficult things I've had to do on a computer. I can install a machine from scratch, get virtualized systems working, connect to a SAMBA share, even get my Linux desktop to talk to a network printer. But can I get a dark network theme across the board? No way!

I recently upgraded from Fedora 16 to Fedora 18. Well not really an upgrade, more of a fresh install of Fedora 18 but kept my existing home directory. I enabled dark themes using the [Gnome Tweak Tool](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeTweakTool). I thought this would take care of it but it only seems to work for some applications: [Evolution](http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/), [Nautilus](https://live.gnome.org/Nautilus), [Gnome Terminal](http://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/) all seem to look just fine. But anything not included with Gnome 3 looks like rubbish.

Here's the [Gnome Tweak Tool](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeTweakTool). It looks pretty nice in a dark theme.

As does the [Gnome Terminal](http://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/), especially with the transparency on the window.

But any other application is horrendous. Checkout [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) on the same machine.

And [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) is also a mess, I was able to get the message window be white on black, but there is no easy way to change the look and feel of [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/). All of the themes are 'cutesy' trying to add splash graphics and what not. See [Thunderbird themes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/themes/) for examples.

And [XChat](http://xchat.org/) is unusable at the moment with the white text on white background in the text entry box.

I've gotten to the point where I gave up on Thunderbird and [XChat](http://xchat.org/) and started using [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) and [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/) since the terminal theme works. But I have to say mutt is ok but I prefer Thunderbird's folders and notifications. [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/) is actually quite workable so if I can't get the themes fixed in [XChat](http://xchat.org/) I can live with [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/).

But this really shouldn't be that difficult, why do app designer think people want whitewashed apps, it's 2013 and we still can't get themes working.
