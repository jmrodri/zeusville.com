Sinc I make almost daily use of [sm-photo-tool](http://sm-photo-tool.sourceforge.net/) to upload my pictures to my smugmug [gallery](http://familiarodriguez.smugmug.com/), I've decided to give it some much needed love. Get your minds out of the gutter, I'm talking about enhancing the software.

[smugmug.com](http://smugmug.jot.com/API) is recommending folks use [REST](http://smugmug.jot.com/WikiHome/REST), [JSON](http://smugmug.jot.com/WikiHome/JSON), or [serialized PHP](http://smugmug.jot.com/SerializedPHP) to access their services. While [XML-RPC](http://smugmug.jot.com/WikiHome/XML-RPC) is still available, it isn't not recommended. sm-photo-tool uses XML-RPC at the moment and I think I'm going to switch it over to using REST instead.

TODOS

*   come up with a logo for sm-photo-tool maybe even a better name too :)

*   update the main page to be much more attractive

*   move from XML-RPC to REST

*   maybe consider creating a Ruby version

*   make it faster
