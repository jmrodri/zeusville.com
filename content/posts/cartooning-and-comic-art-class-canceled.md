Liz called me today to tell me [Wake Tech](http://www.waketech.edu/) canceled the "Cartooning and Comic Art" class I was [planning on taking](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/07/31/cartooning-and-comic-art/). :( I guess I can spend that time working on [zmugfs](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/08/19/fuse-based-smugmug-fs/).
