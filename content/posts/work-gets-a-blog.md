Blogging has certainly taken off and it is definitely interesting how they're used in corporate America.

From Dave Johnson's weblog [Are you blogging at work?](http://rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20040805) and Mark Pilgrim explains [Personal vs. corporate blogging](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/08/11/corporate-blogging)

And the greatest thing is that we have [blogs](http://www.redhat.com/apps/blogs/) at work now too.
