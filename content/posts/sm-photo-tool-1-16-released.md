Hey there [Smugmuggers](http://smugmug.com/)! I'm releasing version [1.16](http://github.com/jmrodri/sm-photo-tool/downloads) of [sm-photo-tool](http://github.com/jmrodri/sm-photo-tool/tree/master) tonight. For those that don't know, sm-photo-tool is a command line program that aids in managing your photos on [smugmug.com](http://smugmug.com). Given a directory of photos, you can create a new album on smugmug.com, then upload all of the pictures in the directory into that newly created album.```
\[jmrodri@firebird ~\]$ cd myphotos
\[jmrodri@firebird  myphotos\]$ sm-photo-tool create 'my photos album'
\[my photos album\] created with id \[9164554\]
\[jmrodri@firebird myphotos\]$ sm-photo-tool update

```This release is mainly a maintenance release but I also refactored the code from a single python file to a series of modules, and cleaned up the available commands. REFACTOR Version [1.15](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sm-photo-tool/files/) of sm-photo-tool contained a single python script, while this is easy to use, it is a bear to maintain. All of the commands were moved into smcommands.py as new classes.Â  I then replaced all of the horrible option parsing from the previous script in the individual command classes. Thanks to [yum](http://yum.baseurl.org/) and [tito](http://github.com/dgoodwin/tito/tree/master) project for the inspiration in moving the commands to a separate module. COMMAND LINE OPTION CHANGES In the process of refactoring I deemed a few of the commands as redundant and merged them into other commands.```
