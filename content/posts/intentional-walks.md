As a baseball fan, I've never really understood the [intentional walk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_walk) strategy.  Well, I mean I understand what the team is trying to do that is walk a more powerful hitter in order to get to the next batter who is statistically inferior.  But I don't think I've ever seen it work out.  Today, the [Chicago Cubs](http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=chc) intentionally walk [Washington National'](http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=was)s [Zimmerman](http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=475582) in order to pitch to [Dmitri Young](http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=124693).  Walking [Zimmerman](http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=475582) loads the bases.  And what happens you ask?  Young hits a [GRAND SLAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_%28baseball%29)! I think the [Cubs](http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=chc) should've taken their chances pitching to [Zimmerman.](http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=475582)
