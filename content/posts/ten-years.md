Ten years ago today I joined Red Hat's Satellite team. It's been amazing to see the company grow from 850 people to well over 6000. Lately I've been working on the [Candlepin](https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin/) project. ![](http://candlepinproject.org/images/logo-frontpage.png) ![](http://zeusville.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/linkedin.png?w=290)
