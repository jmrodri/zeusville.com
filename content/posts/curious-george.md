Tonight I ducked out of work early so we could take Adan and Marco to their first movie ever. We had a quick dinner so we could get to the theater in time for the 7:20pm show. It was a perfect night because Adan doesn't have preschool on Friday's, and Marco, well, he's only two.

We got Combo #3 (2 medium drinks, large popcorn, and 1 candy). Marco loves popcorn as does Daddy.

I had mixed emotions about going, I was excited to be taking the boys to their first movie. But I was also afraid of them not being able to sit still for the movie. I was pleasantly surprised tonight. Marco sat quietly and enjoyed the movie, while Adan sat most of the time. There were only about 10 people in the theater (including us 4). It was a great time.
