Yeah, it's probably bad form to wish yourself happy birthday, but I'm not one to follow the rules. I had a really great day, though it was busy, it was good. Left work a little early to see Adan's tee ball game, it was 98 degrees outside and humid. Afterwards, we went to [Milton's](http://www.miltonspizza.com/) to cash in my free birthday entree! I had my favorite dish, Ocean City pasta. When I got home I had a Cake Batter Confetti ice cream cake from [Cold Stone Creamery](http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/cakes/signature_cakes.html). On the present side, I got a Maryland baseball t-shirt, a [Doctor Who Sonic Screwdriver](http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/cubegoodies/8cff/), a set of [Office Monkeys](http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/cubegoodies/a1a2/), and an [Acrobot](http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/cubegoodies/6748/), and an Amazon gift card. It was an excellent day.
