I've been working on RHN Satellite for the past 4 years here at Red Hat, and I'm so excited that we have opened up the source as project [Spacewalk](http://spacewalk.redhat.com). I'm proud of the work we did to get this project out, kudos team! Checkout the website at [spacewalk.redhat.com](http://spacewalk.redhat.com) or the wiki on [fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki](https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki). Don't forget to find us on [freenode](http://freenode.net/) on #spacewalk or sign up for the [mailing list](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/spacewalk-list).
