Today Adán went pee in the toilet like a big boy! HURRAY! We didn't want to push him but it's definitely time and a requirement for pre-school. He's fully capable but has been fighting Liz all the way. But today at 1:40pm he went pee in the toilet. So now he's enjoying some Mt. Dew and M&M's.

Congrats to Adán!
