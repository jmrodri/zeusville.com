Today Adán went pee in the toilet like a big boy! HURRAY! We didn't want to push him but it's definitely time and a requirement for pre-school. He's fully capable but has been fighting Liz all the way. But today at 1:40pm he went pee in the toilet. So now he's enjoying some Mt. Dew and M&M's.

Congrats to Adán!

Of the 14 posts on your blog, only 2 have anything remotely to do with java. Why are you on javablogs if you want to post about potty training?
