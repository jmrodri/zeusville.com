One day at work we joked about getting OS/2 Warp running in a guest (I'm was an OS/2 user as late as [2004](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2004/04/09/ecomstation-aka-os2/)). I decided to dust off the old OS/2 Warp 4 CD and give it a shot. It installed surprisingly easy, and I forgot how ugly it was :) Here are some of the installation screenshots: **OS/2 boot splash** [![OS/2 diskette boot splash](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5163/5224727555_dafa7d01bf.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jmrodri/5224727555/ "OS/2 diskette boot splash by jmrodri, on Flickr") **boot diskette** [![OS/2 install boot disk](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5224727541_5deddefcc3.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jmrodri/5224727541/ "OS/2 install boot disk by jmrodri, on Flickr") **OS/2 text install** [![OS/2 initial text install](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5242/5224727545_235d112780.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jmrodri/5224727545/ "OS/2 initial text install by jmrodri, on Flickr") **OS/2 setup** [![OS/2 Setup](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4083/5224727547_bd86d0e644.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jmrodri/5224727547/ "OS/2 Setup by jmrodri, on Flickr") **OS/2 gui install progress** [![OS/2 gui install progress](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5224727551_9bc329c3df.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jmrodri/5224727551/ "OS/2 gui install progress by jmrodri, on Flickr") **OS/2 Warp 4 installed and running** [![OS/2 installed](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5048/5224727559_0645f6e3e9_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jmrodri/5224727559/ "OS/2 installed by jmrodri, on Flickr")
