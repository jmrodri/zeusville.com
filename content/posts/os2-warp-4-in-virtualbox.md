One day at work we joked about getting OS/2 Warp running in a guest (I'm was an OS/2 user as late as [2004](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2004/04/09/ecomstation-aka-os2/)). I decided to dust off the old OS/2 Warp 4 CD and give it a shot. It installed surprisingly easy, and I forgot how ugly it was :)

Here are some of the installation screenshots:

There's a guy in #rpm on freenode porting rpm to os/2. You should check it out.

While cleaning recently, I found my OS/2 Warp 4 install CD. I considered doing exactly this same thing (except in virt-manager), then decided I didn't have time and threw it away :(
