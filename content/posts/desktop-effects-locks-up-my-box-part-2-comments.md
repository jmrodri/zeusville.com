Hi Jesus, You know, I had the same trouble on my laptop, which also has an ATI video card. However, I didn't ever get it to lock up on my desktop machine, which has an NVidia card and I've got the proprietary driver installed. I suspect the driver. I haven't, yet, tried the proprietary ATI driver (if there is one).

I have the same problem (since some time ago) with two PCs: one with a nVidia card and the other with an ATI card. When I installed FC6, compiz worked well (on each of my PCs). But some time ago I noticed that the upper face of the cube was empty (no image) and no image even displayed for the skydome. The error reported in my .xsession-errors file is the same you have reported. I tried to specify other png files but the problem persist. I tried with a svg file and the image was shown in the cube upper face but not in the skydome. Have you any idea/solution about that?
