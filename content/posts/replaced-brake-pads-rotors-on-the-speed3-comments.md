When using a c-clamp to push in the caliper piston keep in mind that you'll get small amounts of rubber from the seals in your brake lines. To avoid this you should definately open the release valve and let the brake fluid escape. Otherwise you may end up getting these small amounts of rubber in your abs sensor and will have to replace the sensor.

Wow, you really had a hard time doing the job but i bet it was well worth it. Considering the fact that you saved a lot and you also learned a lot. I can definitely vouch that some auto shops can really overprice with their labor and car parts. It's a nice guide for replacing car brake pads and it is definitely a good walk through on what to do when you face this scenario.
