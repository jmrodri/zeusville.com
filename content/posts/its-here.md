My phone arrived today! After two years, I finally get to replace my aging [Motorola](http://www.motorola.com/) [V276](http://www.motorola.com/consumer/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=400bab651780b010VgnVCM1000008206b00aRCRD&show=productHome) phone with my brand spanking new [Samsung SCH-u740](http://zeusville.wordpress.com/2007/07/28/new-cell-phone/). I also bought a [Bluetooth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) headset: [Plantronics](http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/?_requestid=195844) [Discovery 645](http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/products/cat1150057/cat1150057/prod5520016) DSP and a holster. I'll get to try out the headset today in a conference call. ![](http://www.plantronics.com/images/catalog/product_large/discovery640.gif) The Motorola was an ok phone but it wasn't very rugged. I dropped it a few times on concrete :) It never cracked externally but I think it got a little dain bramage. The sp eaker quit working which meant no speakerphone and no ringing. The charger connection got flaky in the last 3 months causing the battery not to charge unless it was in a specific position, and the tip of the headset jack broke inside the receptacle almost 2 months into owning the phone. But alas, I can finally lay it to rest. I'm thinking of going "[Office Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_space)" on it. For the non-techie readers of my blog, "going 'Office Space' on it" refers to a scene in the "Office Space" movie where the characters destroy a finicky printer:

*   _The Printer_ — In the movie, this appliance's unreliability finally prompts Peter, Samir and Michael to take a baseball bat to the device in an open field as "Still" by the [Geto Boys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geto_Boys "Geto Boys") plays, in a scene visually referencing a violent episode in _[Casino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_%28film%29 "Casino (film)")_. The term **_Office Space_\-style**, or "Going _Office Space_ on" is used to refer to this type of destruction.[\[2\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_space#_note-1)
